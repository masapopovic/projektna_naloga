The murder causes chaos and Sanctus' deputy, Credo, orders Nero to go after Dante, who is heading for Fortuna Castle. Nero is equipped with a sword (Red Queen), a revolver (Blue Rose), and powers from his Devil Bringer arm that works like Dante's Devil Trigger. They also give Nero special abilities: pulling and pushing enemies, slamming them on the ground and zooming across areas. Overall gameplay with Nero is still hack-and-slash but with fresh attack styles and techniques. Dante joins later in the game for some levels of his own. His gameplay stays mostly intact with the four attack styles: Trickster, Sword Master, Gunslinger, and Royal Guard."

These were later rolled together into Episodes from Liberty City, which was released as a standalone game. The Complete Edition went further and combined the base game with the Episodes from Liberty City expansion on all platforms, replacing both, as of March 19, 2020.  Because the multiplayer component of the game was designed to use Microsoft Games for Windows Live, which is now long-defunct, all multiplayer modes are no longer available.  GTA IV now essentially a single-player-only game. ---- The Serbian ex-soldier Niko Bellic had witnessed the horrors of war, which turned him bitter and cynical. Disappointed by life, he immigrates to the United States, which his cousin Roman enthusiastically describes as a country of wealth and pleasure. However, the reality is quite different: Roman is poor, has no stable job, and owes money to some dubious individuals. As Niko attempts to help his hapless cousin and pave a more secure future for both of them, he becomes more and more involved in the life of crime. A burning desire to find a man who had betrayed him in Serbia forces Niko to make deals with his conscience, and once he crosses the line, there is no way back... Grand Theft Auto IV is the ninth title and the fourth main game in the Grand Theft Auto series, and also the first for the seventh generation of consoles. Following the tradition of the 3D installments of the series, the game is entirely located in one of the three cities of the original GTA, Liberty City, but now in present time, and with an environment reminiscent of GTA III, though bigger and more detailed. Liberty City is heavily based on New York, where the protagonist has to gain respect, welfare and power throughout the game. Like in most GTA games, the city map is gradually uncovered during the course of the game. The player starts in Broker (based on Brooklyn), and, in order to access the other three districts of the city (based on the other major boroughs of New York City), has to make progress in the storyline. The game has the usual structure based on missions. The player can sometimes engage in various missions at the same time, and has free access to the non-mission features of the game while being on one. Most of the usual elements of exploration and interaction with the city are included in GTA IV. Niko can cause mayhem in the city, hijack cars, listen to radio stations, observe the behavior of the citizens, enter thematic buildings, work as vigilante, taxi driver, or ambulance driver, hire a prostitute, go to a strip club, and so on. Among the new features is the possibility to watch television (with several channels broadcasting various fictional programs) and connect to a fictional Internet, with functional websites (mostly of a humorous nature) created specifically for the game, and an e-mail program. Other additions include looking for criminals in the police department database from a police car, hiring taxi cabs to safely travel to selected destinations, extensive usage of the mobile phone, improved A.I. of the pedestrians, and others."

The presumed era of world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called \"Heaven Smile\", which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the International Ethics Committee (IEC). Meanwhile, the relationship between the United States and Japan deteriorate, as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA. A group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government. The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as \"Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon\", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were professional assassins in their lives, and whose souls were absorbed by Harman after they were killed in a mysterious incident fifty years ago. Garcian Smith is the leading persona among these seven, and the only one who can communicate with Harman. Killer7 is a hybrid game that incorporates shooting and puzzle-solving with light role-playing elements. The player can switch between any of the seven characters during most parts of the game. Each character has unique abilities. Dan, for example, is a true marksman, while Coyote is an experienced thief with exceptional movement. The unusual cast also includes the blind Con who moves very fast, Kaede with ranged skills, Mask who has the deadliest arsenal, the albino Kevin who can turn invisible, as well as Garcian, the leader of the pack who possesses the ability of reviving the bodies of slain personalities. Despite its 3D environments, character navigation in the game is restricted: playable characters can only move along pre-determined (though often branching) paths. Drawing out a weapon switches the view to first-person perspective with free camera rotation, but no possibility to move. Typically, the player should eliminate the approaching enemy as quickly as possible before sustaining damage, using various combinations of characters and weapons. Defeated enemies (particularly those dispatched with critical hits) yield the player \"blood\", which can be turned into serum in special rooms and used to enhance the abilities of the characters. A considerable portion of the gameplay is dedicated to solving various puzzles and gathering plot-related information by conversing with the game's exotic characters."

Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces.\r\nIn the game, the Helghast are a faction of human descendants who colonized the planet Helghan many generations ago. The planet's harsh environment forced the Helghast to adapt and mutate so much that they can no longer be considered human. They are stronger, faster and more resilient than their human cousins, and possess a burning hatred for humanity. Except for a small number of half-breed Helghast and trained troopers, they require a gas mask and air processing tank that creates air similar to that found on the planet Helghan.\r\nThe player takes control of I.S.A. Captain Jan Templar, who is fighting off the Helghast invasion. Templar and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the I.S.A. operative Gregor Hakha and the information in his possession. During the course of the game, the player also takes control of several other characters, such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Staff Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy. As the game progresses the player discovers that General Stuart Adams, a high ranking ISA officer, is a traitor and a servant of Joseph Lente (the commanding General of The Third Helghast Special Forces Army) and was responsible for sabotaging the SD platforms, rendering them unable to defend against the Helghast. The Earth Defense Fleet (EDF) go to assist the Vektan Army, however Adams kills General Voughton and receives his security key, allowing him to reboot the platforms, and prepare an ambush for the EDF relief force.\r\nJan and the others confront Lente, only to find out that Hakha was a commander in chief for him. Lente says that Hakha's family was ashamed to even be related to him, except his brother who talked of his heroism. Because of this, Lente had Hakha's brother shot down. With anger in his eyes, Hakha shoots Lente dead.\r\nThe team fly to the central SD platform and confront Adams, who is wounded by Templar. The platform begins to break up and Adams is killed by falling debris while trying to escape. Finally, the team restore the SD platform, allowing the EDF fleet to fight off the Helghast."

        "daljsi_opis": "Metal Gear Solid 4 is the fourth major game in the Metal Gear Solid series developed by Hideo Kojima. It ties up all of the loose plot points of the previous games while bringing back a number of characters from the earlier games in the series such as Colonel Campbell, Naomi Hunter, Otacon, Meryl Silverburgh, Mei Ling, and many more. The game's main antagonist is Liquid Ocelot. Most of the story and the relationship are explained through cut-scenes with a considerable length. Due to the series extensive history, knowledge of the prior games is recommended to fully understand the story. As the story begins Solid Snake, now looking like an old man due to accelerated aging, is being deployed in the Middle East on a mission to stop Liquid Ocelot. The game is set in 2014, five years after the Big Shell Incident of Metal Gear Solid 2. Liquid aims to take control of the Sons of the Patriots, the nanomachine system used to enhance the capabilities of the mercenaries of different factions. By this, he plans to assemble an army. The game is divided into five acts followed by an epilogue and a briefing. The various missions bring Old Snake to more than one location, including the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe, and a few more that can surprise the players familiar with the franchise. In this game, all of the actions of the previous game have been included along with some new ones such as the ability to roll on your back and fire and the ability to hide in bins scattered around the environment. Similar to the Subsistence re-release of MGS3, the player has full control of the camera rotation on one analogue stick while walking with the other. Shooting is now enhanced to support a new shoulder camera not seen in the franchise before, much similar to that of Resident Evil 4 which will help you to easily counter-attack the enemy without having to fire randomly or switching to 1st-person perspective. The Close Quarters Combat system has been redesigned and players are now able to interrogate guards for information or supplies. The earlier camouflage system has been replaced with Octocamo that allows Snake to blend into the environment. The stamina meter from Snake Eater has been replaced by a stress meter. Based on the fighting and the climate conditions it can offer additional accuracy and reduce sustained damage. The other meter, Psyche, reduces accuracy and can be replenished by reading an adult magazine, eating, or drinking. Snake has access to the largest arsenal of weapons ever made available in a Metal Gear game, with a large array of pistols, rifles, and explosives, along with the ability to mod the weapons adding scopes, suppressors, lights, and other equipment to create custom weapons. Other gadgets in the game include the Solid Eye, which is an electronic eye patch that can be used as binoculars, night vision goggles, or just a device for displaying information about enemies and items scattered around the levels. There is also the Metal Gear Mk. II, which is a small robot that can be used to scout levels and electrocute enemies knocking them out for a period of time. The game also features a complex multiplayer mode, simply entitled Metal Gear Online. Aside from the usual suspects of multiplayer shooter modes, such as \"deathmatch\" and \"capture the flag\", there are some original modes that are based on the stealth aspects of the single-player games. \"Sneaking Mission\" mostly plays out like a standard team deathmatch, with the exception that one player is assigned to control Snake, who is equipped with his radar and Octocamo. Snake's goal is to tranquilize his enemies in order to acquire their dog tags, without getting spotted. If there are enough players in the game, one player will also control Metal Gear Mk.II to assist Snake. \"Team Sneaking\" is basically \"Capture the flag\", in which the attacking team is equipped with stealth camouflage and non-lethal weapons. The defending team can only see the attacking team's shadows and weapons."

Kennedy to Europe on a top-secret mission to investigate the disappearance of the president's daughter Ashley. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out who or what is behind everything. Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter. Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third-person perspective, the game features a new \"behind the back\" movement camera angle and an \"over the shoulder\" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game. The entire item system has also been revamped, so that smaller items no longer require an entire item space to hold. Instead, items take up blocks of space in a briefcase according to their real-life size, to allow for many more items and weapons. Leon can collect treasure from enemies or from the surrounding area, and visit the infamous \"merchant\" to purchase bigger briefcases, treasure maps, weapons upgrades, and powerful weapons such as the one-shot RPG. There is also the Mercenaries from Resident Evil 3, which allows the player to play survival scenarios as characters such as Hunk and even Albert Wesker himself."

Facehuggers will attempt to attach themselves to the player character's face, implanting an embryo inside them which will then kill them. \"Warrior\" Aliens are the primary enemies and are based primarily on the appearance of the Alien in Aliens. \"Scouts\" are faster and will spy on the player characters' activities. They will work in small groups or alone. These Aliens will be based on the appearance seen in Alien. \"Drones\" primarily carry and position eggs and work in the heart of the Hive serving the Queen; they were originally going to be in Aliens along with the \"Warriors\".

With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus. God of War: Chains of Olympus is chronologically the second chapter in the series, which focuses on vengeance as its central theme. Chains of Olympus is a prequel set ten years before the original God of War. Gameplay is similar to the predecessors but with some minor changes. Kratos goes through levels killing enemies and bosses, solving box-based puzzles and doing quick time events. He also collects red orbs to power up his weapons and abilities, Gorgon eyeballs to increase his health and Phoenix feathers to increase his magic power. The game's controls were adjusted to fit the PSP's reduced amount of buttons. Both the shoulder buttons and the analog stick are now required in order to dodge. The most well-known God of War weapon, the Blades of Chaos, are also present. There are several new weapons and magic spells available, including Sun Shield, Efreet spell and Light of Dawn. The game starts when the Gods send Kratos to the city of Attica to defend it from the invading Persian army.

For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes. Similar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slide across the floor or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how \"stylish\" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat. Besides the normal combat and the action/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat their highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points."

NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:\r\n• Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.\r\n• Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.\r\n• Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.\r\n• AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray.

        "daljsi_opis": "The planet Pandora isn't much more than a desert filled with bandits, mercenaries and adventurers. Their goal: the legendary vault which is said to be filled with treasures beyond imagination hidden on the planet by an ancient highly advanced alien race. One of those fortune-seekers is the protagonist, who has one advantage: the guidance of the Guardian of the vault. Borderlands is a mixture of a first-person shooter and a role-playing game, somewhat similar in concept to Hellgate: London. At the beginning of the game the player chooses between one of four characters: - Roland: A former soldier. He likes to play with rifles and shotguns and has a Scorpio-Turret at his disposal to keep his back clear.\r\n- Lilith: A Siren and Phasewalker. She can turn invisible and fights with extreme speed.\r\n- Mordecai: A hunter. He prefers to snipe enemies from a distance and has access to a bird of prey called Bloodwing.\r\n- Brick: A Berserker. He doesn't care much for guns and instead uses his fists to win all arguments. Each of the four characters has three different skill trees available, filled with talents that e.g. increase bullet damage or allow the player to resurrect a friend in cooperative game. The player gets one skill point to spend at each level up, which is earned through gaining enough experience points by killing enemies and fulfilling quests for the various NPCs inhabiting the planet Pandora. To kill all those enemies and survive the journey, the protagonist will find weapons, ammunition, useful items like shields or medipacks, upgrades and money on the enemies he or she kills, in chests scattered around the landscape, or purchased at vending machines. Weapons and shields come in different types of quality, can have several different types of attributes and mostly come with a level requirement. The maximum level a character can reach is 50. Since the protagonist has to travel around much, he or she has a buggy available armed with a machine gun and a rocket launcher or heavy machine gun at later levels. Since the game also features a drop in/drop out-coop-mode for up to four players, the buggies have enough room for two players with one using the mounted turret and the other driving around the vehicle. The Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands includes the following: - Base game.\r\n- The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned add-on pack.\r\n- Madd Moxxi's Underdome Riot add-on pack.\r\n- The Secret Armory of General Knoxx add-on pack.\r\n- Claptrap's New Robot Revolution add-on pack.\r\n- Fold-out Map of all the Borderlands Pandoran Territories.\r\n- Early access to the Duke Nukem Forever demo."

        "daljsi_opis": "A devastating nuclear war had wiped out almost the entire population of the Earth. The civilization, as we know it, has been destroyed. The Earth has become a huge wasteland populated by mutated creatures. Only small number of humans survived and they formed communities living on the surface, where they mostly scavenge what remains from the pre-war civilization. Some lucky people managed to reach safety of the Vaults, huge underground dwellings, during the war. Recently, the water purification controller chip in Vault 13 broke. Without clean water, the people of the Vault cannot survive. One person is sent to find a replacement chip and ventures outside to face a dangerous world, hoping to return within a hundred and fifty days. Fallout is a role-playing game that utilizes a character development system called S.P.E.C.I.A.L., an acronym formed from the first letters of the game's basic character attributes: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. In addition to having these attributes, the protagonist can also learn and improve skills, as well as acquire traits and perks.  Skill points are awarded when the player character levels up; traits are assigned during character creation, while perks are obtained every three character levels. There are eighteen different skills in the game, divided into combat, active, and passive categories. Combat skills include weapon proficiencies (e.g. small and big guns, melee, etc.); active skills are used for support or interacting with the environment (doctor, lockpick, science, steal, and others); passive skills are mainly dedicated to social interaction (barter, speech, gambling, and so on). Traits bestow various benefits upon the character while also imposing penalties; in contrast, perks are purely beneficial. By developing and customizing attributes, skills, traits and perks, the player is granted a considerable freedom in shaping the protagonist in his combat-related and social behavior.  The game has an open world which can be freely explored from the onset. Only a few quests are required to complete in order to advance the main plot; a vast amount of side quests is available. Thanks to the game's emphasis on social interaction, many problems can be solved in a non-violent way; in fact, it is possible to complete the game without engaging in battles at all, running away from enemy encounters and concluding the final confrontation in a relatively peaceful fashion. Conversely, the player can opt for a destructive path, killing everyone in sight. A Karma system is used to track the player's moral decisions during the game. Combat in Fallout is turn-based. Participants have a limited amount of action points (AP) per turn; each action (including movement) depletes a certain number of AP, eventually ending a character's turn. The player can target specific body parts of enemies during battles. Characters may join the protagonist, traveling together and participating in combat as a party. Though the player may assign general commands to the companions, their actions are controlled by the AI, and they cannot be customized."

But instead of advancing the story of the original game, it puts the player in the shoes of Sergeant \"Psycho\" Skyes who has to hunt down Colonel Ji-Sung Lee, a ruthless political officer of the Korean People's Army and his mysterious cargo container. Like in Half-Life: Opposing Force, the events take place at the same time as Nomad, the hero of the original game, is traveling over the island and end when Nomad and Psycho meet back up on the aircraft carrier. This also means, if the player has played Crysis, he already knows what is inside the container. The basic gameplay remains the same, as the player follows the helicopter that is transporting around the container. He still needs to shoot many Koreans and fulfill main and secondary objectives, given by his female contact. But there are subtle changes: While the island is still very big and the player can still choose how he wants to advance, the game gives him more direction, making it a more linear experience like in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare if the player follows the lead. The Koreans now don't take so many hits, till they drop to the ground and the Aliens have adopted the AI of soldiers, changing them from dumb individual monsters to intelligently acting threads with new tactical abilities, like shielding one another in groups. To counter this, Psycho has access not only to the original weaponry but also to the new grenade launcher FGL40 and the short-range micro machine gun AY69, which can be duel-wielded. And to top the new arsenal off, a hovercraft and an armored scout vehicle have been added to the car pool. In addition to the single player campaign, the game again also features a multiplayer mode which has now been made into a separate game called Crysis Wars. Besides the two original game modes Instant Action (Deathmatch) and Power Struggle (Destroy the enemy HQ), Team Instant Action (Team Deathmatch) and seven new maps have been added to the repertoire. \r\n \r\nCrysis Warhead is a stand-alone expansion game and does not require the installation of the original Crysis to play."

Fallout: New Vegas, like its predecessors, takes place in an alternate timeline where a war over resources sprouts up in the 1950s and ultimately culminates in a nuclear apocalypse. The game is set in the wastes of Nevada, surrounding the city of New Vegas, the successor of the old Las Vegas, a gambling paradise seemingly untouched by nuclear devastation. A war is brewing in this territory between the NCR (New California Republic) and various tribes of raiders, including the Great Khans and Caesar's Legionnaires. The NCR is a group that wishes to preserve ancient weaponry as well as bring law and order to the wastes, no matter at what price. The player takes on the role of a courier who is assigned to deliver a package to the mysterious and enigmatic Mr. House, the owner of New Vegas. However, once the package finds its way to its destination, a man in a checkered shirt and a pair of thugs intercept the courier and begin to dig an open grave. The courier is shot, buried, and left for dead, but is later dug up and brought to a doctor in a nearby town by a robot who saw the events transpire. The protagonist must now find out who tried to kill him/her, and why. Gameplay primarily resembles its immediate predecessor, Fallout 3, utilizing the same engine, interface, and most features. Like the previous game, Fallout: New Vegas is open-ended and focuses on exploration. Although each game begins essentially the same, once the player has molded the protagonist's base stats, traits, sex, and appearance, the game progresses in a largely non-linear fashion. The player can pursue the main quest, or explore the wastes and take up side-quests from various NPCs. The main character will level up as he or she gains experience by completing quests, doing unique actions and defeating foes."

But you're not going alone... your companion will be a redhead by the name of Aline Cedrac who has her own reasons for tagging along. Aside from being a woman and inexperienced in the world of danger, she is the only one with the knowledge for translating the ancient Abkhani tabloids which may hold the secrets behind Carnby's friend's death and the disappearance of Aline's father. Upon arriving on the island, your plane has been shot down by the things unknown, and the heroes have no other choice but to jump with a parachute, thus separating them on the island. Now you choose the character to play with, either as Edward Carnby or Aline Cedrac, as they explore the mysterious and gloomy island with all its secrets and parallel stories that contain different locations and tasks for different characters, thus adding the level of replayability in a different experience - Carnby's story is more action oriented while Cedrac has more puzzles to solve. Just like in the predecessors you move your characters through pre-rendered backgrounds while the camera perspective switches around. You collect various items and books which are used to solve puzzles. Many situations can only be solved with violence which means you'll have to use guns to get rid of your foes. Aiming is manual and especially when playing Cedrac ammo is scarce. Saving a game uses up a save medallion which can be found during the game."

They are ambushed by a WEC mech, and two of the Silencers are killed. The remaining one, a nameless captain, (whom the player plays as), joins the Resistance, where, as a significant symbol of the WEC's military power and political philosophy, he meets with resentment, distrust and outright hatred. However, he uncomplainingly undertakes dangerous missions, often with substandard equipment, and his continued success gradually earns the respect of his fellow Resistance members. The Captain eventually uncovers secret plans for a WEC space station, the Vigilance Platform, which can attack any location on Earth from space, meaning cities with a known Resistance presence can simply be annihilated at the leisure of the WEC. All such cities are threatened with orbital bombardment unless they surrender. Concurrently, the player's Resistance cell is betrayed from within, and almost all the non-player characters are killed. Despite these setbacks, the Captain infiltrates the Vigilance Platform and destroys it. The traitor is also on the station, guarding the lifepods, and challenges the Silencer to a duel over the access card for the last pod. As the Vigilance Platform is exploding, the Captain is contacted by Chairman Draygan, who swears vengeance against the Silencer."

The game takes place in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have appeared from beneath Manhattan and decimated the city. To fight back against the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was found unconscious and suffering amnesia two years before the game's events. Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of battles against the Twisted. At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the origin of the Twisted and regain her memories."

The game introduces Raiden as the central character; a child soldier transformed into a half-man, half-machine cyborg ninja, equipped with a high-frequency katana blade and a soul fueled by revenge. In the near future, cyborg technology has become commonplace throughout society. Three years have passed since the collapse of the Patriots system that had been secretly controlling the global power balance from the shadows. However, peace remains elusive. The dissemination of cybernetic technology has triggered instability and conflict as those who control the trade gain increasing power. Furthermore, large 'Private Military Companies', or PMC's, that had been supported and controlled by the Patriots have collapsed, spawning countless rogue entities with origins to larger criminal organizations. These renegade PMCs employing cyborg technology have become increasingly more disruptive shifting policy and power at will. As a member of the peace-keeping PMC 'Maverick Security', Raiden lives by the mantra of protecting and saving lives. But as the world plunges further into asymmetric warfare, the only path that leads him forward is rooted in resolving his past, and carving through anything that stands in his way."

Two sequels to the game were released. Parasite Eve is a horror action role-playing game developed by SquareSoft (now Square Enix). The game is a sequel to the novel Parasite Eve, written by Hideaki Sena. It is the first game in the Parasite Eve series. The game takes place over a six day span in New York City in 1997. The incident starts on December 24 and ends on December 29. The game begins with Aya Brea, an NYPD rookie, attending an opera with an unnamed date. During the opera, everyone in the building spontaneously combusts, except for Aya, her date, and an actress on stage named Melissa Pearce. Aya confronts Melissa backstage, and Melissa says that Aya’s mitochondria need more time to develop. Melissa then mutates into a beast and flees into the sewers, declaring that her name is now Eve. There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started. Mitochondria have taken on a new life of their own and begun to infest the city of Manhattan. It's up to NYPD detective Aya Brea to unearth the mystery behind this infestation. Journey through the dark streets of Manhattan as you battle mutated rats and other hideous creatures on your way to Eve, the central figure of the mitochondria attacks. Developed by Square, the same people who brought us the epic Final Fantasy RPG series, Parasite Eve is a three-disc RPG in a third-person perspective with 3D rendered backgrounds. You are allowed to roam around in real-time, polygonal battle sequences. A unique option lets you customize weapons, armor and character abilities. The game is compatible with analog controllers and takes up only one block of memory for saves. The game package also contains a bonus CD, Square Soft's 1998 Collector's CD Vol.1. This collection of demos and previews includes an interactive playable demo for Xenogears, the opening movie sequence for Bushido Blade, a preview movie for Brave Fencer Musashi, and a special preview movie for Final Fantasy VIII."

        "daljsi_opis": "Team Fortress 2 is the successor of Team Fortress Classic and is also a class-based multiplayer team shooter. The game features nine classes which cover all the classics from the original game including the Heavy Weapons Guy, the Pyro and the Spy. Each class has a different set of weapons and abilities. While the Heavy Weapons Guy has his mini-gun and moves slowly over the map, the medic stays in the background and uses his healing beam to assist the Heavy. If he does so long enough the medic can then trigger an Übercharge which makes both targets invulnerable for a few seconds. The spy is instead more of a loner and disguises himself as the enemy in order to infiltrate them and make instant melee-kills. To use all these classes the release version of the game features six maps with different gameplay modes. On the remake of the TFC-map \"2Fort\" you play old-school CTF. On \"Granary\" and \"Well\" the teams need to capture all five control points in a chain (much like in Dark Messiah of Might & Magic) in order to win. \"Dustbowl\" and \"Gravel Pit\" feature assault-type gameplay were one team is placed in the offensive and the other in defense. Last but not least on the map \"Hydro\" the teams fight over two points at one time in an attempt to reach each other's main base. In April 2008, a new game mode called Payload was introduced with the map Gold Rush. In payload the blue team has to push a rail kart carrying a bomb through a series of checkpoints before eventually detonating it in the red teams base. The red team has to defend the checkpoints and prevent the cart from reaching the end of its route within a limited time. The game logs every player activity and makes intensive use of statistics. Even when you die the game tells you for example how long you've survived and if you've done better in the past. At the end of each round you get a personal overview with statistics for every class and like in Battlefield 2 you can access all the stats from the main menu. Also included are a developer commentary and a bunch of achievements. Graphically Team Fortress 2 features a unique graphical style called \"signature\" which gives it a very comical and humorous look but without the black cell-shading elements that you know from games like XIII.

        "daljsi_opis": "Some time during the 2050's, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed \"gray death\" is running rampant throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as \"Ambrosia\" manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French terrorist organization \"Silhouette\" bombs the historic symbol of friendship between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at UNATCO headquarters. Deus Ex is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points, which may be distributed to increase JC's proficiencies in eleven different disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency. Another way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant DC abilities that can be used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased, and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to them. The game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits, as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player's preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways, e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to System Shock games, the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use, and discard various types of objects."

While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power, they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent them from escaping. As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead. Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth, and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram. Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana. Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of the quest. Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation. Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area."

In Diablo the main body of the story takes place beneath the floors of a cathedral in a small town known as Tristram. It is here that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, is defeated by an unnamed warrior after many previous battles are also won.\r\nThe unnamed warrior that vanquished Diablo drove the demon's soulstone into his forehead, in an attempt to contain the monster's essence within his own body. Later in the canon it is suggested that this is what Diablo intended so that, should he be defeated, he had an \"escape plan\" in place of dying.\r\nThe unnamed warrior is ill fated from the moment he does this and is gradually corrupted over the course of the next few days by the demon's spirit. Deckard Cain recounts the story to the next band of adventurers that pass through the Rogue Encampment in Diablo II. It is one of these adventurers that appears in the wake of the destruction caused by the now possessed unnamed warrior, and attempts to find out the cause of the evil, starting with the corrupted warrior (known as the Dark Wanderer throughout Diablo II)."

As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave gamers more than they ever expected. Novice Mode - This Botmatch competition is where new flak fodder hit boot camp. The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born and addiction begins... Hardcore Mode - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. Enhanced Bot AI - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real. Radio Chatter - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents' messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too). New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. UBrowser - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the \"Play Online\" button and then selecting a server from the list, the game is on. Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler, the camera can be \"attached\" to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely."

Some cars are earlier models of the vehicles from GTA III. A few missions also involve the protagonist navigating a boat. New to this installment is the ability to drive motorcycles. Tommy can drive a variety of two-wheeled vehicles, from huge Harley-esque bikes to dirt bikes to a standard motorcycle. Flying is also a bigger part of the game, as the player can fly small planes and helicopters, traveling from area to area, landing on helipads on top of towering skyscrapers."

        "daljsi_opis": "The events of the game take place in the early 1990's. The player takes control of Carl Johnson (C.J.), who had moved to Liberty City in order to distance itself from his past as a member of a gang in his home city, San Andreas. But the past catches up with him in a way he had not imagined: he finds out that his mother was killed by a rival gang. He goes back to San Andreas to attend her funeral. Realizing how corrupted local police is, seeing how his relatives and friends need him, determined to avenge his mother's death, C. J. has no other choice but revert to his old ways. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the fifth game in the GTA series. The basic premise remains the same: roam the \"sandbox\" environments, hijack cars, and complete missions to advance the story. The game's world is significantly larger than in its two immediate predecessors, encompassing three cities and a vast countryside between them, with smaller towns, mountains, rivers, and other places of interest. The interactivity with the environment is enhanced, since the player character can now swim and dive, being able to access every corner of the game world. The missions vary in structure and gameplay, including chases, races, longer and more intense third-person shooter sequences, as well as a wide variety of vehicles to navigate, which range from different new types of cars (such as lowriders), bicycles, motorcycles, to boats, helicopters, planes, trains, and exotic devices such as monster trucks and jetpacks. Some of the missions involve recruiting gang members and attacking turfs belonging to rival gangs. As in the previous games, there are many activities to perform outside of the missions. Working as a taxi driver, taking part in races, delivering sick people to hospital, etc., return from the preceding games in the series. San Andreas adds many new activities of its own, some of them with a role-playing flavor. C.J. can go to gym and work out, increasing his stamina. From time to time he has to eat - though overeating will make him look fatter. He is also able to have romantic relationships with certain female characters, asking them out on a dinner, giving them presents, etc."

Liandri entered into the Tournament, as it is officially called, sponsoring their own team, the Corrupt. The Corrupt's leader, Xan Kriegor, quickly achieved champion status and held it for two years. In 2293, a human named Malcolm dethroned him and became champion himself. A huge media figure, Malcolm is hailed as the biggest star in human history and is worshipped as a god. His success nets great rewards for his sponsoring corporation, attracting the attention of jealous rivals both in the arenas of the Tournament and in the corridors of power a galaxy away. Liandri attempted to win back the champion title with Xan MK2 but failed (unknown to the other contestants, each member of the Corrupt is purely robotic, including Xan).\r\nNow it is 2302. The Tournament is undergoing a massive overhaul. The aging Sniper Rifle (a relic of centuries past) is removed from the Tournament as is \"Assault\" - a team-based event that forms a part of the competition. Many fans of the Tournament complain at these changes, with some combatants refusing to participate in the new format. Malcolm, shortly after his victory, hired two of his former opponents (Brock and Lauren, members of the former Iron Guard team) as teammates in his reformed Thunder Crash team. But the Axon Research Corporation, another of the four great corporations, entered the Tournament as well, sponsoring the geneboosted Juggernaut team, led by the brutal and savage Gorge."

This long forgotten evil, now wrought upon Boletaria, plunged the realm into darkness and fog. A mighty demon horde poured into the kingdom, devouring the souls of men. Champions from other realms learned of Boletaria's fate and sought to deliver the kingdom from evil; none would return from the cursed land.

        "daljsi_opis": "Gabriel Belmont is a member of the Brotherhood of Light, a group of holy knights who serve to protect the innocent from the forces of evil. His wife Marie, recently murdered by the same evil, now lies trapped between the Earth and the Heavens. Her soul along with many others is neither living nor dead. Gabriel finds out that the Lords of Shadow are behind everything, and that they possess an item known as the God Mask that could bring his beloved Marie back from the dead. Together with Zobek, another member of the Brotherhood, he sets out across the ruined landscapes of Earth; filled with everything from werewolves, vampires, and undead beings, to end the Lords of Shadow destruction. Gabriel vows to do everything in his power to get his Marie back, even at the cost of falling into the darkness he seeks to destroy. Castlevania: Lords of Shadow is a 3D reboot of the Castlevania series. Taking place during the end of days in 11th century 1047, it follows the journey of Gabriel Belmont as he seeks to revive his wife and save the world from evil forces. The gameplay in the game is very similar to that seen in God of War. It depends on using a chain whip known as the Combat Cross to fight against enemies. As you progress through the game, the player gains access to an assortment of combos available to purchase with experience points gained in battle. The Combat Cross can also be upgraded to be used as a grappling hook to help with the many platform segments in the game or even be fitted with a spiked chain that helps to saw through obstacles. Gabriel gains the ability to utilize magic at a certain part of the game. Magic is split up into two types; light and dark. Fighting with the light magic equipped will recover Gabriel's health with each strike of his whip. Fighting with the dark magic equipped will enhance Gabriel's power and deliver more damage. Secondary items such as silver daggers and holy water can also be used in battle. While the game is a reboot of the franchise, many will recognize some popular characters and enemies seen in previous entries. At all times, the player has access to an in-game character guide that gives descriptions on all characters and also tips on how to defeat all enemies. Each level in the game contains hidden magic gems that when collected, will enhance either Gabriel's health, light, or dark magic. Secret brotherhood arks are also scoured around the levels but usually need an item that can't be gotten until later on in the story. Replaying a level will give you an opportunity to complete different trials. These trials range from anything such as kill X amount of enemies or beat this boss in X amount of time. Doing these helps to unlock different trophies and achievements, and also to extend the replay value of the 20+ hour long adventure."

A new world order emerged, splitting the world into two distinct yet dependent worlds: Above and Below. The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary. Enemies will hear you running and shooting, so if you decide to take an action, be aware that they will surround you and launch a team strike at you from all the sides. You only effective aid against them, beside your weapon, of course, is the ability to perform a roll or lean against the walls and fire from the corners, although aiming itself may not be easy as your hand will not be steady while on the move or panicking."

Born into a poor family from Sicily, he grows up in the city of Empire Bay and soon becomes best friends with Joe Barbaro, who convinces him that crime is just a way to get easy money. After having attempted a robbery, Vito is arrested and offered a choice by the authorities: go to jail or join the army. Choosing the latter, he is drafted and sent to Italy to fight Mussolini and his followers. After being injured and discharged, he returns to Empire Bay and learns that his deceased father owed a large amount of money. Willing to protect his family from debt collectors, Vito contacts Joe, and the two gradually begin to steer their lives towards organized crime, unaware of the price they will have to pay for that. Mafia II shares the theme and the basic gameplay concept with Mafia; though it takes place at a later time and follows the life story of a different protagonist, the game's plot has a few connections with that of the predecessor. The game's story begins in the 1940's and extends into the 1950's. The story follows a linear path and is divided into chapters, each telling a separate episode in Vito's life and his trials and tribulations after getting involved with the mafia. Like its predecessor, the game combines free-roaming driving with third-person shooting stages, focusing on the latter. Though the player is free to explore the city (driving a car or on foot), most of the driving gameplay is confined to the missions, which involves getting to the destination, stopping to buy items, hijacking different cars, etc. There are noticeably less chases or violent encounters during the driving sections than in the previous game. Police may arrest Vito for speeding or violent behavior; the player has the option to bribe officers in exchange for freedom."

Designed around co-op (Cooperative) play, it puts people against a city of millions of infected people, primarily based in the United Kingdom, with weapons ranging from pistols to explosives. Players must arrange their group to most effectively counter the waves of enemies, including adopting specific strategies such as barricading themselves in, or finding high ground. The objective is to survive as long as possible against continual \"waves\" of enemies. The number of enemies in a given wave is a calculation of how many players are left. The number of enemies that they must defeat before the round ends is displayed on the HUD. Upon defeating the required number of foes, the wave will end, and shortly thereafter the next will begin, bringing more difficult foes. In order to fight off these increasingly challenging enemies, players must acquire money by killing zombies. The amount of money gained per kill depends on the difficulty of the enemy. Money acquired by players can then be spent at the Trader's shop, which opens at the end of each wave."

        "daljsi_opis": "The manly tough-guy stereotype is on the verge of retirement, over a decade after he saved the world from aliens in Duke Nukem 3D. America is awash in hero-worship of the man who conquered the aliens with movies, books, restaurants, and action figures (to name a few things) of their favorite muscle-bound action hero. One day, on the way to his own talk show, Duke learns that aliens have landed on the earth once again. However, this time their intentions seem to be unclear and Duke is asked by the president to restrain himself, for fear of offending the aliens and provoking another war. Duke reluctantly agrees - only to find out, much to his relief, that the aliens are hostile after all, which means that the pop culture icon is finally back to his old ways! Duke Nukem Forever is a first-person shooter that largely relies on the gameplay style of its predecessor, known for testosterone-fueled gunplay and humor. A few elements characteristic for modern shooters have been introduced: Duke has a health bar that refills over time, and carries only two weapons at a time, similarly to Halo. Duke Nukem also spends no time ducking behind cover, attacking, and bounding forward to cover in the way squad-based or tactical FPS titles do. Rather, players will charge through stages, running and gunning for most of the game. Beside weapons, Duke can use pipe bombs and laser tripwires to damage the enemies, throw items, consume steroids and beer to increase his strength and reduce the damage he takes, respectively, as well as use a jetpack to fly short distances (multiplayer only). He can also use a holoduke, which creates a hologram of himself, confusing the enemies, and activate the Duke vision if the area is too dark. As in Duke Nukem 3D, it is possible to interact with parts of the environment; some of these interactions bestow benefits to the protagonist, including permanently increasing his ego bar (substitute for health bar). The game also features various set pieces and levels that focus on driving, platform jumping, and light puzzle-solving. In certain levels Duke will shrink in size, and will have to overcome obstacles before he can be restored to his old self again. Other activities include driving a monster truck or a radio-controlled car, turret-focused gunning segments, mini-games (e.g. Duke Nukem pinball machine), massive boss battles, and the classic visit to a strip club. Of course, it just wouldn't be a Duke Nukem game if it didn't feature the Duke's crude, dry commentary throughout the game."

It is also the last game of the series to have an arcade release. Eurocom (who had previously developed the Sega Saturn version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) later ported it to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color during 1998. An updated version titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released exclusively for the Dreamcast the following year. The gameplay system in Mortal Kombat 4 is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted Elder God Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm many years prior to the beginning of the series. The other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness from conquering all the realms."

The third title in the Turok series allows you to choose who will become the successor of the Turok lineage, either Danielle Fireseed or her brother Joseph.

Each also has unique upgrades to basic weapons. While Danielle's shotgun upgrade coats the shrapnel in napalm to immolate anything they touch, Joseph's instead charges them with electricity, causing them to ricochet off of walls and floors. The story is told through in-game cutscenes with highly detailed models. There are no keys to collect this time around, as each level leads linearly into the next.

Ezio's story takes place immediately after the end of Assassin's Creed II, and has him leaving Rome to head back to Monteriggioni. There, he is ambushed and the Piece of Eden he has found is stolen. He must head back to Rome, which has since been seized by the Borgia, rescue its people, and recover what has been lost. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the story from Assassin's Creed II. Players take on the role of Ezio as they use their assassin skills to liberate Rome and fight against the Templars. Players take on missions to progress the story, earn money and gradually free the city from the influence of the Borgia. Specifically, by burning down the thirteen Borgia towers that are being used to enforce their rule, Ezio can reclaim areas of Rome back for the people, and use his money to restore shops, shortcut tunnels, and even Roman landmarks. By doing this, players also earn a regular income from Rome, which they can claim from any of Rome's banks. New to the Assassin's Creed series is a multiplayer component. The backstory behind the multiplayer mode is that that Abstergo, the Templar organization, is using Animus devices to train their recruits to become Assassins. You take on the role of an Abstergo recruit, and must find and assassinate your target while being tracked for assassination yourself. You must make sure that you do not arouse suspicion, otherwise it will become obvious that you are an assassin rather than a citizen, making it easier for you to be spotted and taken down. As you play, you earn points which allow you to level up and upgrade your character's skills and abilities. The Windows version, both on Steam and the boxed retail package, includes two bonus maps: The Trajan Market and The Aquaduct."

        "daljsi_opis": "Michael Thorton. A name without a past. A person whose life before joining Alpha Protocol no longer exists. Alpha Protocol being a clandestine service without any ties to the US government and specialized in covert operations to protect home and country. Thorton's mission: Assassinate the leader of Al-Samad known as \"Shaheed\". Shaheed's crime: Destroying a passenger plane in the Middle East. An easy task it would seem. But life is never that easy - especially if one has to deal with terrorists. In the end, Shaheed is just the beginning of a greater conspiracy and it's up to Mike and the player to solve it. Alpha Protocol is a hybrid of role-playing game and shooter, bearing certain similarities to Deus Ex. The player takes control of Michael Thorton after his initiation into the world of Alpha Protocol, looking over his shoulder. At the start of the game, the player has to choose one of four classes (Soldier, Field Agent, Tech Specialist, Freelancer). The choice mostly determines his past as he can change all pre-defined skills before the final start of the game. In addition the player has to customize the basic look of Mike, although during the course of the game he is still able to change his appearance at his safe house and certain lockers scattered around the levels. He is limited to facial features (including color) and clothing, however. After the first mission, the player advances the story by sending the protagonist to Rome, Moscow and Taipei, in any order. Here, the player is able to select and prepare his next mission in peace. There's a TV which allows the player to keep up with current events (or get new assignments), a weapons locker to choose his load-out with and, more importantly, a computer to check his email and visit the \"Clearinghouse\". The latter is a black market service where the player can sell stuff he found during missions and buy additional gear (including weapons, armor and special items) or upgrades like a bigger magazine for the pistol. The money needed for that, however, the player has to earn himself. Alpha Protocol doesn't want to be traced back to Mike, so during the missions, the player not only fulfills his given objectives (may they be capturing or killing an enemy or finding intel), but is also on the lookout for money-bags lying around or ways to convince other people to give him some. The conversation system is somewhat similar to Mass Effect 2, offering several different choices. that do not spell out the whole sentence, but only the tone or topic of the answer. As opposed to the BioWare game, the player only has a limited time to make his/her choice. The amount of available choices the player has greatly depends on how much Mike knows about the person he's facing, increasing the need for him to gather intel before, during and after missions. One way again is the Clearinghouse which also offers ways to make a mission easier like bribing a bunch of guards to not show up for work that day. Depending on his choice during a dialogue or simply by answering an email a special way and during normal gameplay, not only his relationship with the person he's talking to changes - news of the player's actions travel around the world, changing how enemies and friends alike view the player even before their first encounter, making it sometimes easier or more difficult for Mike to persuade his opponent. Every person in the game even reacts to certain kinds of attitudes better than others. Being suave to Mina (another employee of Alpha Protocol) may seem a good idea at first but she's more into the professional type for example. If all fails and on his way to the main target, Mike has several other options to deal with a situation, the most obvious one being to pull out one of his several different types of guns and shoot his way through the mission. But even then just going in and pulling the trigger is mostly a waste of ammo as taking the time and aim increases not only the accuracy but also the change to score a critical hit. If the player is more of a peaceful and/or sneaky nature, he can however take the stealth-route. This allows him to make one-hit take downs of an unsuspecting enemy as well as avoid many obstacles. Especially sneaking around involves a lot of hacking, lock-picking doors and rerouting electronics to go around enemies, stop alarms or just get additional intel. Each of these tasks involves a small mini-game which increases in difficulty as the player advances through the game. Each kill, hack, successful dialogue and completed mission objective earns Mike experience points which in turn allow him to level up and earn advancement points. These are used to upgrade the nine available skills like \"Stealth\" or \"Assault Rifles\" up to 10 times. If a skill is completely upgraded, the player can then choose to specialise it, unlocking 5 additional ranks to dump points in. This can, however, only be done for three skills. Investing points into a skill unlocks both permanent bonuses like less recoil when using a pistol to special abilities. \"Awareness\" for example is a stealth-ability which allows the player to see all enemies and which direction they are currently facing even through walls. At higher stealth-ranks, this effect becomes permanent."

        "daljsi_opis": "Two World II is a fantasy role playing game which continues the storyline from the first game. Aziraal was the ancient god of war revered by the Orcs and said to possess immense powers. When Aziraal's tomb was opened at the end of the first game, the god's powers transferred to our hero's sister. Now the dark lord Gandohar, determined to have Aziraal's power for himself, has taken our hero and his sister captive and is draining those powers from her. The escape from the prison acts as a tutorial for the game until the hero finally steps out into Antaloor. There is a huge world to be explored containing deserts, forests, swamps, seashores, cities and rural areas, plus many hidden caves and dungeons. There will be encounters with every kind of monster imaginable from killer insects to huge beasts, as well as humanoid enemies of varied races. Since the levels of the enemies are not tied to the player's level, some fights need to be avoided until the hero advances and increases his abilities. The game boasts that there are enough quests to keep players busy for about 100 hours. In the single-player game, the hero can be a male only. His specialty (warrior, ranger, mage) can be changed at will by swapping equipment. Success as each is entirely dependent upon how earned skill points are assigned. Two Worlds II features improvements over the first game including new user interface, game engine and magic & crafting systems. It includes all of the gameplay elements that were part of Two Worlds I (riding on horseback, crafting, forging, alchemy). Sailing (planned for the first game, but never released) is possible in this game, albeit in only a few locations. Feats and skills can be learned to enhance each form of combat. Learned spells can be combined with each other using the new card modifiers to enhance or change their effects. Improvements to the crafting/forging aspects make it possible to improve weapons and armor differently. For instance, objects in inventory can be broken down to their base elements (cloth, wood, iron). Two Worlds II also offers five multiplayer modes for up to 8 players: Crystal Capture, PvP, Dual, Adventure (7 chapters), and a Village mode. In multiplayer, new characters are created with a choice of several races and can be male or female."

From the colony of LV-426 to the Alien spaceship (which brought the plague to the infested prison colony), all of the 30-some levels pay tribute to the films. Whimpering people are encrusted in the Alien-ified walls (who explode when you shoot them, or spurt chestbursters to punish the loitering Colonial Marine), towering Alien Queens that attack with relentless abandon, sleeping tanks (inspired by the films), and eggs that lazily slip open when a hurting Marine can least afford it. Alien Trilogy also delivers the arsenal Colonial Marines will die to get their hands on. Ranging from a Beretta to a steadicam-mounted smart rifle, Acclaim provides enough firepower for the experienced Marine to show every Alien Queen who's boss. The weapons also enjoy their trademark sounds from the films, including the high-pitched jam of the pulse rifle. Like the films, Alien Trilogy employs incredible savvy in how it uses sound. There's just you and the dark, moody music, the pulse-quickening hum of the motion tracker, and two sets of jaws at every turn."

Alice, now 19 years old, resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Dr. Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes that she is fine, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland. Within the corrupted Wonderland, Alice attempts to learn more from Wonderland's various citizens, including the Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the Mock Turtle, the Walrus and the Carpenter, and the Caterpillar. She is ultimately told that the Queen of Hearts still lives despite her defeat at Alice's hands before, though in a diminished capacity. At the Queen's castle, Alice discovers the Queen's true form, which resembles her younger self.

Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords."

The Prometheans are AIs created by the Forerunners to protect a planet. Unfortunately you're seen as a threat. However despite being made by the Forerunners the Prometheans have a much darker and more sinister plot. Also aside from the Prometheans, Cortana is turning rampant and has begun to turn on the Master Chief. As a new twist, the Master Chief will be working together with the Spartan IV's the replacements to the Master Chief."

Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers dollars to have them remove their top. The main character regularly delivers commentary on the events through one-liners. There are twenty-eight levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, night vision, protective boots, a hologram known as the \"holoduke\", and a jetpack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas.

Demons are replaced by cloned soldiers and the element of horror revolves around an image of a spectral girl always appearing when least expected for a few fleeting moments. The player sets out as a member of a specialized strike force dealing with unknown threats. Initially, the player starts with mundane weapons, which are well presented, and progress gradually towards more sci-fi ones as the danger increases. The player can also call upon a bullet-time ability which slows down time around the player and is realised with impressive visual and aural effects by the game engine. The game takes place in a certain multi-billion aerospace installation which has been hijacked by an elite team of cloned soldiers gone rogue and an unknown supernatural force (which is likely controlling or affecting them in some way). Both threats must be identified and countered. ---- On August 17, 2006, F.E.A.R.’s multiplayer component was retitled F.E.A.R. Combat and made available for free download.  During the next years, Monolith, Punkbuster, Sierra (Activision) and WBGames ended their support for the game, and the game home page stopped offering new CD keys.  The F.E.A.R. Master Server was shut down by GameSpy on December 5, 2012, and, without the master server, the game could no longer start or connect to servers, and was effectively unplayable. Since 2012, a group of FEAR players and supporters have created patches to fix game issues, issue new CD keys, and modify the game to use a different master server.   The game is now playable using that master server, and players can create and join servers again. The F.E.A.R. Combat game and community are hosted at https://fearcombat.org/."

        "daljsi_opis": "Ninja Gaiden 3 is the third main game in the series since the reboot in 2004 and once again stars ninja Ryu Hayabusa as the protagonist. The game starts in medias res with Ryu attacking a giant creature through a quick time event. Soon after it is revealed through a flashback that he was contacted by the government because an unknown group launched a terrorist attack in London and took control of the area surrounding the prime minister's residence, taking him hostage. In a video they declare they want Hayabusa handed to them. He travels to London from Japan but has no intention of just surrendering. Later on in the game it is revealed the group behind the attack is a cult of alchemists who want to establish a new world order with Ryu as the catalyst. From London the journey eventually takes him to a city in the Rub' al Khali desert, Abysmo Island in the Indian Ocean, Hayabusa Village in Japan, the Howard Phillips Plains in Antarctica, the Pacific Ocean, and finally back in Tokyo, Japan. The story no longer involves the struggle with Fiends and Archfiends from the previous games. Just like the other titles in the series gameplay is centered around fast-paced combat with a quick succession of moves to build up combos and fight off multiple enemies at the same time. Moves are performed with a combination of weak and strong attacks. Incoming attacks can be blocked and there is a new slide manoeuvre and a visual camera trick in slow motion when he performs a body-piercing move, along with finishers. Enemies in the air can be attacked using an auto-targeting bow with unlimited ammo and there are also shurikens. The ninja can fly down and attack from the air, use a new technique to climb walls using his kunai with a quick succession of buttons, or sneak up from behind and perform a stealth kill. Many of the opponents are mechanical and equipped with guns. Early in the game he receives an evil curse that fuses his dragon sword into his arm, causing it to pulsate with veins. This makes Ryu feel the pain of each victim as he kills someone. The effect of the curse makes him more powerful or weaker at certain moments in the game. After killing a certain amount of enemies the arm lights up red and he can perform Grip of the Murder to perform a devastating attack. Compared to the earlier games enemies are no longer as deadly efficient in their attacks and Ryu can sustain more damage where an arcade-like approach is often put before strategic and slow fighting. There is no longer a store and items are few. A few new swords are discovered gradually and arrows for the bow also become stronger. The Ninpo concept from the previous games is still present, but in only one form. Defeating enemies fills up a bar and once it is full Ninpo can be activated to transform into a dragon to kill all enemies in the environment and regain full health. In the multiplayer additional Ninpo are available. The save system with statues has been replaced by checkpoints where a falcon swoops down, also restoring health. The game structure is largely linear, but in larger environments a button can be used to sense the path to follow when stuck. After completing the first level Shadows of the World is unlocked, the online multiplayer mode which is a first for the series. It offers cooperative challenges and online deathmatch games for up to eight players simultaneously. Progress is persistent and the experience while fighting is used to unlock new tools and abilities permanently for the character. The PlayStation 3 version is compatible with the Move peripheral for controlling and guiding the attacks."

The remake has the same story and dialogues as the original (although voice-overs were re-recorded for this release). The locations in the game also remained the same, but the graphics were updated to look equal in quality to contemporary games. Gameplay was also enhanced, featuring the additions that first appeared in Metal Gear Solid 2. Snake can now roll, hang from ledges, hide in lockers, drag guards' bodies away, as well as aim and shoot from first-person view. New weapons from Metal Gear Solid 2 (such as tranquilizer gun) are also present.  Another noticeable change is in the game's cutscenes. Directed by the Japanese action movie director Ryuhei Kitamura, the cutscenes have been re-worked, featuring dramatic techniques used in action movies, such as slow motion and other effects."

At least, not at first. With the help of a fellow prisoner, Snake escapes and the game truly begins. Portable Ops is a classic Metal Gear game in almost every sense. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played previous console entries in the series. Snake can peek around corners, sneak up behind guards, they even carried over the CQC moves from Snake Eater. The main addition of Portable Ops is the Comrade System. Instead of the solo missions from previous games, Portable Ops uses a squad-based approach, with Snake having to recruit allies to form a team of trained specialists. Before each mission, the player must compose a four-man squad that will be sent into battle. Each member of Snake's squad has their own strengths and weaknesses. While some units are best utilized on the battlefield, others may specialize in producing items, healing allies, or providing intel for each of the game's maps. Portable Ops has always been a controversial game among the fans due to its unconfirmed canonicity in the series, even Hideo Kojima himself hasn't be able to provide a clear answer in the matter. This has lead to extensive debates and theories if the game truly belongs to the Metal Gear main timeline."

Old friends...and enemies...lurk around every corner as Leon attempts to find out who is truly behind the kidnapping of the president's daughter. Resident Evil 4 is a major change from the previous installments. Instead of a fixed third person perspective, the game features a new \"behind the back\" movement camera angle and an \"over the shoulder\" aiming feature that allows players to control their gun movement for specific body part hits. It features a brand new AI system and more open environments that allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon.

Based on the 1974 film The Godfather Part II, it is the sequel to the 2006 game The Godfather, which was based on the 1972 film of the same name. Like the first game, The Godfather II follows a non-canon character, Dominic, who is initially the protégé and underboss of the original game's protagonist, Aldo Trapani. After Aldo is killed, Dominic is placed in charge of the Corleone family's operations in New York City and tasked with expanding the Corleone empire by taking out their rivals. Unlike the first game, which was primarily set in New York, the story also spans into Miami and Havana. Like its predecessor, The Godfather II tells an original story, which intersects with the narrative of the film on multiple occasions. However, the game changes the film's plot more so than the first game did: none of the material concerning the rise of Vito Corleone is present in the game, and the events of the film are presented in a different order. Additionally, whereas in the first game, most of Aldo's actions took the form of events which happened off-screen in the first film, in The Godfather II, Dominic has a more central role, appearing in numerous scenes in which he was not present in the film; for example, he is with Frank Pentangeli during his attempted assassination, he accompanies Tom Hagen to see Pat Geary after the prostitute is found dead, and he kills Hyman Roth and Fredo Corleone. Unlike the first game, which featured many of the film's actors reprising their roles, only Robert Duvall returned as Tom Hagen, while the rest of the cast comprises entirely new actors. The Godfather II received mixed reviews across all platforms. Common criticisms included graphical glitches, technical bugs, poor AI, and an unimaginative open world design. Many critics also felt the game deviated too much from both the plot and tone of the film, and that it was too easy and too short."

Rayne's primary weapons against both monsters and men are the blades attached to her arms, and as the game progresses she will gain additional attacks to string together. Rayne can also hold many weapons, such as pistols, shotguns, and submachine guns, at once, but she is not overly attached to them and will discard any weapon that runs dry. Her enhanced vampiric strength even allows her to rip up mounted gun emplacements and fire them from the hip. Another vampiric strength is her ability to drain the blood out of any human she can grab in order to restore her health. By killing enemies Rayne's rage meter will fill, eventually allowing her to enter Blood Rage, slowing the world around her and gaining new combo attacks that can dismember or totally cut in half weaker opponents. Rayne's ability to perceive the world will grow as the game progresses as well, allowing her to see living things through walls, zoom in on distant targets, and speed up her perception that everything, herself included, appears to slow down."

The hero knows almost nothing except that he must be important, since everyone is trying to kill him. Gradually uncovering the mystery, the hero, learns more about his secret agent past and his curious name: XIII. The player unravels clues, trying to solve a conspiracy set in an environment that breathes a comic book ambiance. Footsteps and shots are visualized in text and actions: for example, headshots are shown in a series of still images. Aside from that, the game has all the typical FPS elements: both stealth and action, more than fifteen weapons (shotguns, crossbows, rifles, ...), interaction with environmental objects and plenty of enemies in levels spread all over the world. During the game, the player can learn a number of skills such as silent walking, lock picking and dual weapons handling."

The player is able to explore Nazi-occupied Paris, some of the French countryside and parts of Germany.  Color is a key element in the gameplay. Areas which are heavily controlled by the Nazis are represented in black and white, with the exception of the irises of characters' eyes, city lights, blue symbols of the French Resistance, and various German symbols, which are bright red and complete with swastikas. In order to make that district colored (\"inspired\") again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, visually represented by making the area vibrant and full of color. This also affects gameplay; in black and white areas, German soldiers are present in large numbers, making it far more likely that Sean will be detected in his rebellious activities."

The first part of the game is recollection of Hartsock's time in Sergeant Matt Baker's squad during the initial D-Day invasion. The second part picks up when he takes command of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon during the liberation and defense of Carentan, and the eventual link up between 82nd and 101st Airborne Division at the town of Baupte. The final part will take place in and around Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Although the first part takes place under Baker's command, every mission is one not included in Road to Hill 30. The player commands Desola, Allen, and Garnett from 3rd Squad, and some soldiers from 2nd Squad at first. Then the game switches the player to command the entire 2nd Squad after the Battle of Bloody Gulch (Hill 30). Hartsock's squad consists of the remains of the original 2nd Squad (Cpl. Franklin Paddock, Pvt. Dean \"Friar\" Winchell, and Pfc. James Marsh) and the remnants of 1st Squad (Cpl. Jacob Campbell, Pvt. Will Paige, and Pvt. Derrick McConnell). In addition, the player will also be in command of Corporal (later promoted to Sergeant) Seamus Doyle of the 82nd Airborne during the initial D-Day invasion in early parts of the game."

        "daljsi_opis": "Far Cry 3 is an open world first-person shooter set on the fictional Rook archipelago in the Pacific. Even though the tropical setting resembles the original Far Cry, the gameplay itself is closer to Far Cry 2 as the open world exploration is supplemented by role-playing elements with experience points, crafting, trading, hunting and three skills trees. The protagonist is Jason Brody, a daredevil who is on a holiday in the Pacific with his two brothers and some friends. When they take a skydiving trip, they land on an island that is controlled by pirates. They are all taken prisoner by the pirate warlord Vaas and his older brother Grant is killed when they attempt to escape. Vaas sarcastically gives Jason an opportunity of 30 seconds to escape before he hunts him down. Against all odds, Jason succeeds by jumping into the water. He is rescued by Dennis Rogers who introduces him to the Rakyat, the native tribe that hopes to rid the island off the pirates. During the search for the remaining survivors Jason will be initiated into the mysticism of the tribe, discover the environment and hunt down Vaas. After the introduction the player is however largely free to leave the main quest along and discover the islands at his own pace and leisure, as all of the playable area is available right away. The rook archipelago is a dangerous environment filled with pirate settlements and local animals such as tigers, bears, sharks, komodo dragons, boars, goat, snakes, rabid dogs etc. It is split up into different sections that are revealed gradually as soon as a radio tower in the sector has been taken over. These reveal the entire environment and open up quests, but areas can also be traversed without a detailed map. There are various safe houses to travel around and exchange loot at all-purpose vending machines. Players can kill pirates, complete quests, but also collect plants and hunt down animals for their skin. Money is exchanged for weapons, modifications and items such as syringes, but crafting also plays an important role. By discovering recipes, plants can be turned into fluids that are injected to enhance abilities. In addition animals skins are used to craft items that extend Jason's weapon belt up to four slots, provide a larger wallet to store money, increase his ammo belt and a lot more. Completing quests and killing pirates is rewarded with skill points that are used on one of the three available skill trees. These determine the playing style, as Heron deals with mobility and long-range attacks, Spider with stealth and survival, and Shark with assault and healing. For each new skill acquired, Jason receives a tattoo on his arm. Even though it is a shooter with machine guns, assault rifles, hand guns, bows, flamethrowers, mines, RPGs and grenades, almost all of the game can be played with a stealth approach. Jason can crouch and hide in the foliage to remain hidden. A meter shows how visible he is to opponents. By sneaking up on them stealth takedowns with a knife can be performed and bodies can be dragged away. He can also throw rocks or use sounds to isolate pirates. His camera is used to zoom in and mark opponents. Once they are marked they remain visible through an outline even when there are walls or objects in the way, helping to track movement. The same can be done with animals. Moving around is done by foot, but there are also different vehicles such as cars, jeeps, quads, boats, jet skis and paragliders along with zip lines and swimming to move more quickly. If Jason chooses to help the natives, he can infiltrate and take over more than 30 outposts. Once these settlements are cleared, they become property of the natives and a safe house for fast travel and shopping is offered. Every animal and character has dynamic behavior, acting regardless of Jason's actions. That way he can observe animals attacking each other or use it to his advantage to clear a group of enemies, and villagers will move out and conquer more territory independently once Jason clears an outpost. Enemies patrol around the island on foot or in cars with non-scripted behavior. Once Jason is discovered, they will often call in reinforcements from another location and chase him down. Additional ammo and weapons can be picked up from fallen enemies, and money and items are also collected that way, along with many hidden loot chests and additional collectibles such as letters from fallen soldiers during World War II and relics. Weapons that are bought can be re-acquired at any time without an additional cost from the vending machine even when they were lost or exchanged during a quests. Weapons can further be customized through various modifications such as scopes, laser pointers, silencers and more room for ammo. Multiplayer consists of a separate cooperative campaign for up to four players that takes place six months before the events of the main game. It is set on a separate island of the Rook archipelago and features four characters: a thug called Callum, the crooked cop Leonard, the Russian hitman Mikhail and ex-soldier Tisha. They were redeeming their past actions by working on a cruise ship when they are scammed out of their money by the pirates. By pursuing them, they end up on the island. The campaign is split up into six missions that take about an hour each, interspersed with cut-scenes. The missions typically have the characters working together to travel to a location, killing all enemies and then completing objectives such as protecting equipment, finding a specific type of ammo or guarding another player. Experience is also gained here and there are multiplayer unlockables and custom loadouts. Competitive elements between players are also encouraged, such as getting the most sniping kills for instance, with an additional experience bonus. Two additional elements are battle cry and booster systems. Battle cries are temporary buffs that affect team mates in the vicinity and boosters are stronger buffs provided through syringes. The competitive multiplayer modes include team deathmatch, domination, transmission and firestorm. Transmission and firestorm are similar to domination. Transmission is about radio transmitters as control points but they sometimes change locations. Firestorm has each team set fire simultaneously to two fuel dumps held by the other team, while defending their own. Once a successful fire has been achieved, almost the entire environment becomes ablaze and the teams then need to fight over a radio control point. Additional multiplayer bonuses and perks are gathered by unlocking encrypted data with a time limit. In these modes players can also level up through a permanent system and use battles cries, booster systems, revive team mates or call in support. After matches there are interactive cut-scenes where players can choose to show mercy or punish (kill) opponents."

Through two parallel perspectives on the same ongoing conflict, 25 to Life offers play as either a law enforcement officer or a streetwise gangsta. In either case, players are equipped with the tools of their respective trades; cops can make use of their superior training with firearms or call for helicopter air support, while gang members can choose from a wider selection of weapons and use civilian hostages as human shields. The game was built with online play in mind, and several multiplayer modes are supported. Players can customize their characters with tattoos, brand-name apparel, and other accessories, then take them online to join others for team deathmatch-style competition. A full-fledged single-player campaign is also included, casting players in the role of an urban up-and-comer who finds trouble on both sides of the thin blue line. The plot of the single-player game was written by P. Frank Williams, famous for his successes as an author, magazine editor, and television producer.

No one really knows what Hitler and his generals did to bring forth this course of events, but the fall of London made it clear that the Allies had little chance of winning the war. Soon after, the destruction of Moscow and the taking of Washington ended the war. It was hard to believe that it was the German military technique or their leaders' tactical skills. People started to talk about final development of the Wunderwaffe, especially that not many managed to flee from the battlefields to tell what they have seen - their reports were unclear and not explaining anything. Nevertheless the world was unable to stop the Führer and his Reich. In the year 2093, 148 years after the end of the war, the overwhelming Reich rules the Earth under totalitarianism, but Armageddon is nearing. The victory of German troops brought not only terror of Nazi dictatorship but also mysterious weather changes, which are seemingly leading the world towards destruction. General Jurgen Mortyr thinks that the Nazis are somehow responsible for the growing number of disasters and weather changes. The only way to prevent the destruction of mankind is to travel back in time to 1944. General Mortyr assigns his son, Sebastian, the mission to investigate and stop the events that could destroy the future of mankind."

In 2147, two years after the events of Doom 3, the UAC detects a strange signal from one of its Martian satellites, and consequently sends a team in to investigate. After this team finds an Artifact and the forces of Hell are alerted and begin a new invasion. The player, a marine combat engineer who discovers the hellish device, must fight his way through the base to reach the doctor, chased by demons. McNeil, an unseen character in Doom 3, was the whistleblower who notified counselor Elliot Swann and Jack Campbell of Malcolm Betruger's mysterious activities at the beginning of Doom 3. The marine eventually finds her, and she tasks him with stopping the invasion by returning the Artifact to hell. In his journeys he defeats the three Hell Hunters (demons who were supposed to find the Artifact) and absorbs their powers into the ancient device."

However, the true mastermind behind the attacks is actually the newly elected President of Venezuela, Juan Crespo. Crespo managed to get elected by advocating a strong anti-terror platform and exploiting the fear caused by the terrorist attacks (which he himself orchestrated). Crespo's plan is to discredit Saudi Arabia, then cut off the Venezuelan supply of oil to the United States, creating an oil crisis and driving up the price of oil, which he would then sell to the US on the black market at highly inflated prices. Rainbow manages to foil Crespo's plans, and ultimately assassinates President Crespo himself. Rainbow then arranges for the international media to credit the terrorists with causing Crespo's death."

Dying of liver cancer, Gospic plans to leave the world one last legacy of hate from the Second World War by using his vast wealth to resurrect global Fascism.

In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If a specific opponent's car is wrecked multiple times in successive races, it is added to the choice of available vehicles. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses that range from useful (more speed, instant brake) to fun and downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing by finishing first, wrecking everything in sight is encouraged. The game offers open environments where exploration away from the racing course is encouraged."

The creation of this force is seen as a violation of international law and Japan's constitution, and it causes tensions to rise between Japan, China, and North Korea. In time, North Korea and China set up shipping blockades around Japan, and Japan calls on the United States for help, citing article nine of the Postwar Constitution. Throughout this time, Japan uncovers more and more information that the infamous Black Gold Day was caused by intentional information warfare attacks. As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all. In Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score. The single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a \"tunnel\" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location. Throughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales. The Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features.

Raziel is faced with a dilemma: kill Kain and submit to fate, or establish his free will by refusing. Raziel avoids dealing the death blow, changing time again before Kain vanishes.

The vast Ultor Corporation runs the mining operation on Mars. The living conditions are deplorable, human rights for the miners are few and a disease called \"The Plague\" is running rampant throughout the colony with no known antidote available - predominantly within the confines of the mine complex. Parker, a downtrodden miner, came to Mars to make a new start in his life - taken in by the promises and advantages Ultor has to offer in the mines of Mars. After a routine day in the mine with the typical aggression toward miners and cramped living conditions and poor nutrition, he witnesses the spark that starts a rebellion when a security guard abuses a miner at the end of his shift and heartlessly kills him. Parker takes up arms, with the help of Hendrix, a rebellious Ultor security technician who guides Parker through the complex."

With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to the role of an explosives expert (codenamed \"Alias\"), as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth. Eventually, the research was successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. Fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down and executed at once and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as \"The Processed\"."

Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds. As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their \"badge rating\" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small \"struggle\" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station. Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points."

There are three main modes are available: Story Mode, Director's Cut Mode and Mini-Games. Story Mode contains the classic rail-shooter concept, divided in nine levels. Director's Cut features the same levels but enhanced and generally longer. Mini-games are mostly shoot challenges for multiple players. By playing well or unlocking some achievements, the player wins money, which can be spent on upgrading weapons or buying new ones. The game still supports multiplayer for two players simultaneously.

While there's a large arsenal of weapons available to you - ranging from stealthy weapons such as a garrote or a silenced pistol, up to machine guns and sniper rifles - your main weapon will be stealth.

Hitman 2: Silent Assassin brings something new to the series: depending on your stealthiness, you are given a rating upon completing a mission. Going trigger-happy on everyone will result in being called a \"Mass Murderer\", while only the most patient and skilled players will manage to receive the \"Silent Assassin\" rating, which generally involves stealthily eliminating the target without raising any suspicion."

Like Heretic, Hexen is a fantasy game based on an enhanced DOOM engine. All of Heretic's innovations like vertical looking, flying, and the inventory system have been carried over. The new major changes this time around are three characters for the player to choose from and the level hub system. The characters are the Fighter, the Cleric, and the Mage. Each one has four unique weapons and different levels of speed and armor. The hub system steps away from the traditional \"single levels stringed along into episodes\" system which had been carried over into the FPS genre from sidescrollers and made popular by Wolfenstein 3D. In Hexen's hub system each episode is still made up of interconnected levels, but most of the levels are connected to a single \"hub\" level through portals. There are also portals between some of the \"spoke\" levels. Many of the puzzles in Hexen require travel back and forth between different levels. Other innovations in Hexen included weather effects, jumping, earth-quakes, and destructible objects such as trees and vases."

The Raven team enhanced the engine with the addition of an inventory system, the ability to look up and down, and the ability to fly, along with some lesser features such as powerful wind currents.

Beaten by his dad on a daily basis, he looked for a way out and was drawn to the Call of Juarez - a myth about a great treasure buried near the city border of Juarez. His search yields no result and he returns, disappointed, to his birth village to visit his mother. One of the other villagers is Billy's uncle Ray McCall, once a fearsome gunslinger. Twenty years earlier, he decided to shed no more blood and take up the bible instead, becoming a reverend in Hope. When Billy secretly meets with his old friend Suzy, he is chased down the village and becomes an unlucky witness of the murder on his mother and father. He is spotted at the scene near their corpses while the farm is on fire and becomes the prime suspect. Reverend McCall swears vengeance and takes up his guns, disturbing the quiet village life. Fugitive Billy and hunter Ray become the two protagonists of Call of Juarez, a first-person Wild West shooter. Players alternately take the role of the Billy or Ray. Their missions are set in the same locations, they sometimes briefly meet and their actions influence each other, but the paths are entirely different. Both characters can dual-wield revolvers or carry around a shotgun, a winchester or a rifle with scope, but Ray also holds a bible he can cite from to stun enemies, uses his fists, and he can kick and wear a protective vest. Billy on the other hand is younger and more athletic. He can climb rocks, shoots with a bow and uses a whip to scare off animals and swing from branches. Both characters have access to a time-limited concentration mode. Similar to the \"bullet time\" made famous by Max Payne, the game slows down and the cross-hairs of the weapons slowly move from the side of the screen to the middle. Players can use this technique to take out multiple enemies at once. The playing style is also different. Ray usually moves around all guns blazing, while Billy is a fugitive, forcing him to sneak around and hide in shadows. Enemies respond to movement, sound and even flashes of lighting illuminating areas. The story takes the characters through villages, mines, but also train robberies, chase sequences on horses and one-on-one duels based on reflexes. Compared to its contemporaries, Call of Juarez is more similar to Dead Man's Hand with the linear mission structure, in contrast with GUN's large amount of freedom and the open environment. Most objects can be picked up and moved around to the player's advantage - mainly as cover, but also for building structures, opening drawers, pushing carts and throwing oil lamps followed by a shot to set an area aflame. A compass with a red dot always points to the next checkpoint. Weapons need to be reloaded regularly, automatically or manually, and health is replenished through drinks. Players collect ammo from crates or dead enemies and can choose to exchange weapons. The multiplayer mode features online play against up to 31 other people in different modes. From deathmatch and team deathmatch to modes like \"gold-fever\" in which players pick up as much gold as they can find on the map. The Xbox 360 version adds achievements, three bonus missions when you finish the game and ten duel challenges.  Multiplayer mode support was removed from the Steam re-release."

The game style is similar to Spider-Man 2 in which the player is free to explore a large scale version of New York City in a \"Sandbox\" style, this time in a larger city that allows for exploration of the subway and sewer systems. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains like Kraven, the Lizard, Scorpion, Rhino and the Kingpin, or breaking up various gang factions. One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When wearing the traditional red and blue costume, Spider-Man is more fast and is more accepted by the public. When wearing the black costume, Spider-Man becomes stronger and more aggressive. The game also includes \"cineractives\" - cinematic scenes that allow for participation via button presses or controller movements.

The protagonist is Joseph Turok, a former member of Wolf Pack (the enemy in this game), but now a member of Whiskey Company. The mission that led to the events of the game was simple: find Roland Kane (leader of Wolf Pack, and Turok's former mentor) and bring him back to Earth. However, things turned ugly, as the ship was hit by a missile and crashed on the back-water planet. Even worse, it becomes apparent that scientists from the Mendel Gruman Corporation have been terra-forming the planet for accelerated evolution, resulting in dinosaurs hunting Turok, his allies, and his enemy. Joseph Turok's mission is to survive at all costs. Gameplay is about surviving in dangerous environments with both human soldiers and dinosaurs. The dinosaurs can be used as a tool to eliminate soldiers by luring them. All weapons have secondary functions such as a flares to lure dinos. Turok can also choose a stealthy approach with arrows and his trusty knife, in the form of brutal kills. Online multiplayer is also featured, with all the weapons from the single-player game, and some maps have dinos and giant scorpions. The gameplay modes include classics like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and all-new modes borrowed from objective-based war games, such as Assault Capture the flag, and co-op missions. They all have a little twist to them, such as CTF putting a lure on the \"flag carrier\" that draws dinos to the player."

Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red's spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge. Red Dead Revolver features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne. The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier). Each character has his own signature move: for instance, Red's \"Dead-Eye\" slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid \"fan fire\" takedown, while General Diego's flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego's cannons. Beating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money). You can spend your cash on unlockable characters (for the multiplayer game), journal entries that offer backstory and character info, or an array of canonical Old West weaponry, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns of many varieties, as well as knives, molotovs, poison and dynamite. The game features pistol dueling with certain boss characters, as a mini-game mechanic in which you time your draw to an opportune moment and prepare targets as you raise your gun. There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and/or AI bots. Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of power ups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold 'Em) that mix some strategy into the action."

To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall.

Sam has to confront not only the armies of his enemy, but also the Mini Sam, an evil being created by Mental. The story takes Sam through three different settings of Earth's past: Ancient Rome, Ancient China and long lost Atlantis where Sam, as usual, has to wipe out the hybrid army of his nemesis and save the timeline from corruption. On his way through Rome and China, Sam defeats other two Mental's timelock guardians: the gigantic beast Diablotaur and the monstrous Subterranean Emperor Hydra. The game culminates on board of a Sirian mothership, where Sam has to battle the Sirian Dark Lord, a soul of a great Sirian warrior infused with a giant robotic body."

He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy. This game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game."

A group called Lineage decides not to let that happen. They want to preserve the magic for everyone on the planet. A war ensues. Shadowrun is a first-person shooter set in the cyberpunk-urban fantasy cross-genre based on the license of the same name, but not set in the same universe. Instead, the developer created an alternate continuity. The game takes place in Brazil in 2031, before the events that of the actual Shadowrun universe. After the six chapters of the tutorial the player can either choose to fight against bots or go online and play against up to 15 other players in the three different game modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag and Artefacthunt. Each team can choose between the four races: Human, Elf, Troll or Dwarf. Depending on which race you choose, the character has access to different kinds of talents. The Trolls for example have more health than any of the other races and can in addition increase their armor for a short period of time. For every enemy killed or flag/artifact retrieved, money is awarded to invest into weapons and spells at the beginning of the round. Only up to three weapons can be used in one round. Grenades also eat up an entire slot. Next to weapons, players can also purchase magic or tech. This includes invulnerability, teleportation, attacks spells, a radiating healing tree and resurrection for magic, and the ability to see through walls, gliders, enhanced physical attributes, increased accuracy, anti-magic generators for tech. Shadowrun is the first game to feature cross-platform gaming between Windows and the Xbox 360 through the Live service both platforms. If you own a Gold membership for Windows Live (a free month is included in the box) you can play with or against owners of the Xbox360 version and vice versa. To even the odds, the Windows' players aiming reticule is distorted during quick turns and extra stability is given. To counter the pixel-accuracy of Windows players, the Xbox 360 owners are given aim assistance."

The only way out is in, into the the fortress, but to stay out here would be certain death. So in you go, guns blazing... Rise of the Triad, a first-person shooter, is the successor of Wolfenstein 3D, with a somewhat improved 3D engine. Everything is still composed from blocks, but multiple vertical levels have been added; there are stairs made of platforms floating in air, and jump pads which launch you (and the enemies) high up so that you can walk over tall barriers in your way.  The game offers a lot of weapons. You begin with a pistol, but later you can find an extra pistol for John Woo-style shooting, and a MP40 rifle. All these weapons have unlimited ammo. You can also find more potent weapons - from classic rocket launcher, to quite wacky contraptions such as a \"drunk missile\" launcher or the \"Excalibat\", a powerful baseball bat. However, you can carry only one such a strong weapon at a time, and they have limited ammo.  Enemies are mostly humans equipped with various weapons. Their attacks can be quite varied; some of them can steal your weapons (though you can retrieve them after killing them), other shoot nets at you that trap you (you have to wriggle out, unless you found a knife, which will allow you to cut your way out). Apart from enemies, you'll be endangered by fireball launchers, rolling boulders and crushing walls.  There's a lot of power-ups you can pick up. They all have various wacky effects: for example, \"God Mode\" makes you immortal and allows you to toss homing, insta-death missiles; \"Dog Mode\" turns you into a... dog, which can fit into small spaces (and is inexplicably invulnerable to weapons); \"Shrooms Mode\" makes everything shine with bright colours, as if you were on drugs; \"Elasto Mode\" makes you very prone to bouncing off walls when you run into them.  ROTT also offers a lot of multi-player game modes; there's the standard deathmatch and \"Capture the Triad\", but there are also more varied modes - e.g. in \"Collector\" the players have no weapons, instead trying to collect as many \"triads\" as possible; in \"Deluder\", the players earn points by destroying \"eluders\" which move around the level."

        "daljsi_opis": "The House of the Dead 2 is a horror-themed light gun shooter arcade game and the second game in The House of the Dead series of video games. The direct sequel to The House of the Dead, it was developed by Sega for arcades on the Sega NAOMI board in November 1998 then later ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and Microsoft Windows in 2001, and is also found on the Xbox as an unlockable bonus in The House of the Dead III. The game appears in the compilation The House of the Dead 2 & 3 Return for Wii. The Dreamcast version became a Sega All Stars title. The games story picks up slightly over a year after the original game, and follows several AMS agents investigating a zombie outbreak in Italy. The protagonists are tasked find the source of the attack while also locating a missing agent, known as G. Gameplay\r\nThe House of the Dead 2 is a rail shooter light gun game. It includes an auto-reload feature that allows players to point their guns off-screen to reload their weapons without pulling the trigger. Players must shoot their way through hordes of zombies and other monsters while attempting to rescue civilians being attacked. Health is represented by torches at the bottom of the screen and are lost when the play is hit by an enemy or shoots a civilian. Bonus health can be awarded by rescuing civilians and finding first aid kits hidden in crates and barrels. Like the first game, it incorporates a branching path system that allows for a variety of different routes in each stage depending on the players actions. This is expanded upon with far more paths than the original and can even lead to completely different stage layouts/locations, although the general story itself will always remain the same. The game served as the springboard for the arcade, Sega Dreamcast, and PC release The Typing of the Dead, the Nintendo DS release English of the Dead, as well as the inspiration for the Game Boy Advance game, The Pinball of the Dead. The flashbacks to the first The House of the Dead in the game's introductory sequence were recorded using the game's engine. Plot\r\nAMS Agent G's further investigation on the 1998 Curien Mansion incident leads to his mysterious disappearance upon his discovery of the remnants of Dr. Curien's operations in Venice, Italy, where a zombie outbreak takes place. On February 26, 2000, American AMS agents James Taylor and Gary Stewart are dispatched, along with Amy Crystal and Harry Harris, to investigate and evacuate the populace of Venice. They suddenly encounter the impish Zeal, who had recently dealt with G. Upon finding a wounded G alive in a local library, James and Gary converse with him. G gives them a field journal showing the bosses and their weak points. The pair are then met with a massive undead horde, similar to the kind from the Curien Mansion incident. They continue on, trying to save the town's civilians from the zombies. During the chaos, James and Gary face Judgment; consisting of Zeal and his giant, headless, axe-wielding armoured puppet Kuarl. After killing it, they meet up with Amy and Harry, who split up and try to meet at Sunset Bridge (or the wharf, depending on the player's actions). Upon getting there the group faces off with The Hierophant, an aquatic fishlike humanoid which heads an assault on Venice's waterways and Central Plaza. Upon defeating it, James, Gary, Amy and Harry get on a boat and continue through the rivers. It is revealed that the zombies were created by Caleb Goldman, the man who financed Dr. Curien's creations during the Curien Mansion incident. It is also revealed that Goldman created the new zombies and released them into the city. Goldman leaves a message on Amy's phone, inviting them to meet him at the Colosseum, which Harry fears to be a trap. James and Gary split up again, and face off with a group of five fiery serpents known as The Tower. After killing the mother serpent, they receive a phone call for help from Amy, before getting cut off. The two quickly race to the Colosseum only to discover Amy and a wounded Harry, injured by Strength, a giant, chainsaw-wielding zombie which wounds Harry and chases James and Gary throughout the arena. After they kill it, James and Gary push on, while Amy tends to Harry's wounds. They drive over to Goldman's tower, fighting a revived Judgment, the Hierophant, and Tower. Upon reaching the headquarters, they are confronted by Curien's masterpiece, The Magician, who was also revived by Goldman to oversee the birth of The Emperor, a shapeshifting crystalline entity with mastery over magnetism designed to protect nature from humanity. After defeating the Magician, they head to the top of the tower to confront the Emperor. In its prototype stage, the Emperor is not as strong as Goldman had hoped, and falls to the AMS agents. In order to evade being arrested, Goldman commits suicide by throwing himself off the roof of his building. Players are given different endings based on the following conditions: If a solo game was finished as either player 1 or 2\r\nIf both players defeated the last boss\r\nNumber of continues\r\nPoints earned In the good ending, James and Gary run into Thomas Rogan, the main character from the first game, who tells them that G and Harry are all right, and that they should head off to their next battle \"as long as they have the will to live\" (in the case of James) or \"as long as there is an answer\" (in the case of Gary). In the normal ending, as James and Gary leave the building, they are greeted by G, Amy and Harry, as well as a large group of civilians, who thank them for their help. In the bad ending, James and Gary run into a zombified Goldman outside the building. As the screen goes white, a gunshot is heard."

Sure, if that’s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! • Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game.

Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack.

And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! • Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you’ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! • Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2."

Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers dollars to have them remove their top. The main character regularly delivers commentary on the events through one-liners. There are twenty-eight levels, divided over three episodes, set in locations such as streets, a church, a space station, a Japanese villa, a football field and many modern environments. Enemies mainly include aliens, mutated humans and members of the police force that have been turned into Pig Cops. Next to weapons, Duke also has access to medikits, steroids to enhance his speed, night vision, protective boots, a hologram known as the \"holoduke\", and a jetpack to reach higher areas. Most of the gameplay is action-oriented, but there is also an amount of puzzles needed to progress or access secret areas. The game includes network play through the IPX protocol, for deathmatch and cooperative games."

Using eavesdropping, interrogation and pickpocketing, you can find out information about your next target. You can then use this information to choose whether you take on the targets by full frontal assault or with a properly placed throwing knife from the cover of the rooftops. Depending on your choice, you'll have to deal with the citizens and knights of the cities who will become suspicious of a cloaked person wondering on the rooftops or near the mission targets. There are several situations where you can blend in the crowd, with luck, you can take out your target without anyone looking your way.

        "daljsi_opis": "In the year 1960, a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating, Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture, a paradise of free will built in the 1940s by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack's main motivation while he tries to survive the horrors that free will can create. BioShock is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once-proud social experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950s. The game's plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture's inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to System Shock games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements that further tie BioShock to its spiritual predecessors. At its core, however, the game is more action-oriented, restricting the role-playing mechanics of System Shock 2 to abilities and upgrades that can be acquired and equipped by the main character. Most of the enemies in the game are Splicers, the deformed and insane citizens of Rapture. The protagonist has an arsenal of firearms to combat them but is also able to use plasmids, which act similarly to magic and deplete a special energy called EVE. Various types of plasmids may directly hurt enemies, sabotage their movements, or enhance the player character's defense. Combat tactics often rely on successive usage of different types of weapons and plasmids. For example, encasing an enemy in ice with a plasmid makes it possible to shatter it to pieces with a single shot; protecting himself with an electric shield, the protagonist can electrocute enemies and strike them with melee weapons, etc. The player can only equip a limited number of active and passive plasmids, and also has an inventory limit for every type of item. Restoring and enhancing items can be found by exploring the environment or purchased from vending machines. These can also be hacked, similar to turrets, cameras, safes, and other types of locks. Hacking is presented as a Pipe Mania-like mini-game. Plasmids, on the other hand, are mostly purchased by spending certain amounts of a mutagen known as ADAM. This mutagen can be obtained from mysterious creatures called \"Little Sisters\" - little girls that can be seen in most of the game's locations, accompanied and protected by very strong, genetically enhanced humans grafted to armored diving suits and nicknamed \"Big Daddies\". In order to capture a Little Sister the player normally has to defeat her Big Daddy. Afterward, the player has the choice of killing the girl, harvesting large amounts of ADAM in the process, or sparing her life. Depending on the player's moral decisions concerning the Little Sisters, the game's story will be concluded with different endings. The Playstation 3 version adds a harder difficulty level called \"Survivor Mode\" to the game."

His head is thrown from an alley at the woman's feet, with Rayne walking calmly up to the woman. The woman seemingly breaks down crying, but in fact only hides her face to reveal she is in fact a vampire. After a brief fight, Rayne decapitates her and then takes off before a small army of vampires tries to catch her off guard. She drops a grenade on their position as she leaves. On top of the buildings, two mysterious men, who were watching the events unfold the whole time, are discussing their reason for being here. One reveals they are here to recruit Rayne, who is trying to find where her father is. The other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave a necklace with their symbol on it (as seen on the game cover)."

The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version.

The Interstellar Fleet Commander sends out the Special Operations and Reconnaissance (SOAR) squadron to investigate. Their shuttle is destroyed by a merciless and unknown assailant. Everyone manages to survive, and reach the ship intact. What they encounter is something they never would've thought of. As Patrick, the leader of SOAR, you are tasked with exploring the ship, putting the pieces together, and rescuing any survivors you can find. The ship you are on, the Ozymandias, is a dynamically changing structure, which enables you to move hallways and re-position doors so that you can access new areas all the time."

After being hit on the head by a satellite dish, Peter wakes up in a hospital believing that Mr. Belvedere (from the 1980's sitcom) has kidnapped his family, and everyone in town is an accomplice. Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode. Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt's prized racing dog Seabreeze. Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father. Brian's game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay. Stewie's battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram's lair and stop him from taking over the world.

It is the fifth title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 1999's Grand Theft Auto 2. Grand Theft Auto III is played from a third-person perspective in an open world single-player environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The game is set within the fictional city of Liberty City, which is loosely based on New York City.[b] The story features a mute, nameless protagonist, although he is later referred to as Claude in his cameo in the prequel Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[c] Claude is a bank robber who is left for dead by his girlfriend, and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime, and corruption. Upon its release, the game was acclaimed by many reviewers who praised its concept and gameplay, which was coupled with the use of a 3D game engine for the first time in the series. However, the game's violent and sexual content has been the source of much public concern and controversy. It became the best-selling video game of 2001, and has sold over 17 million copies as of 2011. The game is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. The success of Grand Theft Auto III was a significant factor in the series' subsequent popularity; as of 2008, five prequels set before the events of Grand Theft Auto III have been released, particularly Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories which revisits the Liberty City setting just three years prior. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, was released on 27 October 2002, and also received critical acclaim. In December 2011, in celebration of the game's tenth anniversary, a mobile version of Grand Theft Auto III was released for iOS and Android. The game has also been ported to various other platforms and services, such as Mac OS X and the PlayStation Network."

For example, in the first mission you see Mr. Pink holding his famous monologue \"I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up!\" and then you play Mr. Blue as the police arrives at the jewelry where your goal is to get out alive. To do so, you have two choices: be a psychopath and shoot your way out, or try the subtle approach without harming anyone. For instance, if you do not want to harm anyone you can take a hostage and then threaten the police to lay their weapons down and order them to face the wall. There are a few missions in which you must drive a car but mostly you walk through them. Like in the Hitman series, the game shows at the end of every mission how well you have done."

The multiplayer side eventually became the most popular part of the game, and was influential in the genre. Splash Damage, an independently owned game developer in London, created some of the maps for the Game of the Year edition. Splash Damage also developed a downloadable multi-player only sequel called Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, which is one of the most popular free downloadable games on the internet.[2] A further sequel, titled Wolfenstein, was released on August 18, 2009."

        "daljsi_opis": "Scarface: The World Is Yours is a 2006 open world action-adventure video game developed by Radical Entertainment, published by Sierra Entertainment, and distributed by Universal Interactive for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Wii. An Xbox 360 version was also being developed, but was cancelled. The game is not a direct adaptation of the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, but is instead an unofficial pseudo-sequel which changes the end of the film so that Tony Montana (originally played by Al Pacino) survives, and sets about exacting revenge on those who ousted him from power by re-establishing his drug empire in Miami. The game features Al Pacino's likeness in the character of Montana, but Pacino does not voice the character, as he and the game's producers felt his voice had changed too much since 1983. Instead, Montana is voiced by André Sogliuzzo, who was personally selected by Pacino himself. Actors from the original film who did voice work for the game include Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia and Al Israel. The game received mixed to positive reviews, with many critics comparing it favorably to both 2002's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (which itself was influenced by the Scarface film[5]) and 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. It was also praised for maintaining the tone of the film, for its humor, and for the accuracy of the depiction of Montana himself. The game was also a commercial success, selling over one and a half million units across all platforms."

Like the Gold Edition, it features levels from both first and second chapters; the weapons from the second part can be used when playing the levels of the first one as well. The levels are generally somewhat smaller than in the PC release.  The most significant change comes in the form of a life system. Scoring 100,000 points grants the protagonist an additional life, allowing him to respawn at the same place after having been killed, rather than forcing the player to return to the last checkpoint. Combo points are awarded for executing specific attacks rapidly, contributing to the overall score. The save system has been somewhat modified, with telephone booths representing checkpoints."

Double Agent was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 in October 2006. The Wii and Microsoft Windows versions were released in November 2006. A PlayStation 3 version was released in March 2007. Originally the game was set for a March 2006 release, but Ubisoft moved the release date to October 2006 in order to have more development time. Ubisoft then released their fiscal quarter results for Q1 2006 and announced that Double Agent would be put back at least one month in order to boost Q3 2006 income. There are two separate versions of Double Agent. One version was made by Ubisoft Shanghai, who developed Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and was released on the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 3. The other version was made by Ubisoft Montreal (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory) and was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Nintendo Wii. The Ubisoft Shanghai version features a completely custom engine while the Ubisoft Montreal version plays more like the classic Splinter Cell games. The games share the same general plot but feature different storylines, plot twists, and levels. They do however, share the same background music, a few cut scenes and all voice actors. The version for mobile phones was developed by Gameloft."

In this game, you play as the zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains. Stubbs the Zombie is set in a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one day as he zombifies the entire city. Before becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet. Luckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to take control of enemy humans and their weapons."

It was also the first game that Capcom published that was developed by a Western company. Despite relatively high expectations during development, given the developers' previous work on the hugely successful Tomb Raider series, upon release, it received generally negative feedback by most game critics and players due to an evidently rushed release. Most complaints centred on the glitchy AI and numerous other technical inadequacies, coupled with a poor storyline and characters."

Brütal Legend is set in a free-roaming world inspired by heavy metal album covers, with the primary mode of transportation around the world being Eddie's car \"The Deuce\" (AKA \"The Druid Plow\"). Combat is mostly basic hack-and-slash, alternatively attacking with either Eddie's axe or his guitar Clementine.

Fans are spent to create units that can be commanded and even double-teamed with for devastating results. The ultimate goal of most of these missions is to destroy the enemy's stage before they destroy yours. Upgrades can be purchased for Eddie's combat abilities and his car from The Guardian of Metal at the center of the Earth.

Worse: they get help by a known terrorist who tries everything to let escalate the tension into a full-scale-war. In the middle: the player. During his missions he will slip into the shoes of PFC. Joseph Allen, Sgt. Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson who is a member of Task-Force 141 and the hero of the first game, Captain \"Soap\" McTavish – leader of said task-force. As it's predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person-shooter that provides a fairly linear but heavily scripted and action-oriented single-player-experience. The missions take the player all over the world shooting, sneaking and driving through enemy lines to fulfill his various objectives like blowing up a fueling station. To fight all those hordes of ever respawning enemies, he has access to a large collection of modern-world-weaponry but can only carry two weapons plus grenades at a time. This is also true for the multiplayer-mode of the game which again features an extensive ranking system with the players gaining experience points for killing enemies, winning a round or completing objectives. Once enough experience points have been collected, the player advances in rank and unlocks new game-modes (ranging from deathmatch to pure team-oriented modes), new dog-tags and new weapons and abilities with which he can create his own custom class besides the five standard classes available. Also available is a coop-game-mode for two players called \"Spec Ops\" featuring several missions going on besides the main campaign in three different difficulty-settings with several different objectives including getting from A to B in a certain amount of time.

Which means that the game is primarily a close-quarter fighting game but you will stumble upon long-range weapons such as pistols, shotguns, rifles and so on.

There are also new attacks in the game such as Environment Kill and Chain Attack. Environment Kill is pretty much what it seems like, after beating down an enemy to his knees you can choke grab him and use your environment as a final blow, like throwing him headfirst into a TV, while Chain Attack is like a combo system which is activated when a bar on the screen is filled. You fill this up by beating down a number of enemies. Ethan Thomas is working under SCU (Serial Crime Unit) again so his Forensic Tools are back. Only this time you'll have to choose which gadget to use for the crime scene instead of letting the game choose it for you. Accomplish Points is also back in the game and these increase depending on how good or bad you finish a level. Unlike the first game, there is now a multiplayer section for up to eight players with different modes, such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, bomb rush (time-based games between SCU Agents versus Influenced bums) and crime scenes (the Influenced need to hide evidence that SCU agents need to track using their equipment)."

        "daljsi_opis": "Far Cry 2 is an open world first-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released on October 21, 2008 in North America,[1] October 23, 2008 in Australia,[2] and October 24, 2008 in Europe.[1][3] It was made available on Steam on October 22, 2008.[4] Crytek, the developers of the original game, were not involved in the development of Far Cry 2. It is the second installment of the main Far Cry series; the sequels Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 were released in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Ubisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, however the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a modern-day Central African nation during civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate \"The Jackal\", a notorious gun runner. As of January 23, 2009, the game has sold 2.9 million copies.[5] \r\nFar Cry 2 is a sequel to the original Far Cry. The game features an open-ended experience. Players are able to ally with one or multiple factions, and to progress through the game world and missions as they see fit, resulting in a nonlinear style of gameplay commonly referred to as sandbox mode that allows the story to progress at their speed and in the order they choose.[6] Players can use a range of vehicles, including cars, trucks, boats and hang gliders, to travel within the 50 km2 (19 sq mi) gameplay area. The playing styles range from head-on assaults to stealthy infiltrations and assassinations. The game takes place in a sprawling African landscape, with terrain ranging from desert to savannah to jungle.[7] Various factions and vehicles are featured; enemies include human mercenaries.[8] There is a dynamic weather system that has a day-night cycle and different weather conditions such as storms and strong winds. The time of day also affects the behavior of AI, in terms of enemy alertness and aggressiveness; for example, an enemy might have a slightly heightened awareness at night, but be unable to see the player in hiding, while during the hot part of the day the enemies might be sitting in the shade in groups but easily spot the player from a distance. The health bar represents the health of the protagonist that is divided into five segments, each of which automatically refills if it is not depleted and the player finds cover for a few seconds. Players carry a limited supply of syrettes which can be used at any time to fully replenish the health bar, and are obtainable from first aid boxes located throughout the game world, specifically at guard posts. When nearing death (only one health bar remaining), the character must perform first aid on himself, for example removing bullets with pliers, or snapping twisted or broken fingers into position."

In the beginning was the Firstborn. The Firstborn was a true image of God. Perfect to the core, a creature with no sex, neither dark nor light and both beautiful and terrible to behold. God feared his creation and left it unfinished, banishing it to the Abyss and created Adam instead with all his flaws. But the Firstborn had already touched the Earth. Leaving behind a taint so powerful that even God's expulsion couldn't keep it from breaking through into the mortal world to reclaim it's birthright. In a remote desert in the Middle East the Earth was wounded. Eon after eon the Firstborn continued to fester, breaking down the fabric of reality as human civilization flourished around it. According to an ancient prophecy the Firstborn will successfully break through into the mortal world seven times. Bringing with it diseases, corruption and perversity until seven mystics come and sacrifice themselves to drive it back into the abyss. This has already happened six times. Now once again the ground under the city called Al-Khali trembles as the Firstborn enters the world one last time to either be defeated in a last battle or find eternal freedom. During the centuries every civilisation made sure that those seven mystics would stand ready to defeat the Firstborn and this hasn't changed. Known as the Jericho Squad they are now called to Al-Kahli. The city in which one travels further back in time as he ventures deeper into its heart until he reaches the beginning of all. The game is a pretty straight-forward First Person Shooter but every one of the seven members of the Jericho Squad has different abilities and uses different weapons. While Cpt. Devin Ross uses the Patrioteer (a combination of shotgun and assault rifle) and is besides Father Paul Rawlings the only member of the team that can heal wounded teammates, Sgt. Wilhelmina \"Billie\" Church is more of a samurai. She uses a Nodachi as a melee-weapon and a rapid-fire sub-machine gun in addition to Blood magic which allows her to summon either a Blood or a Fire Ward. Although your teammates do a pretty good job on their own, later on you have the ability to take over one of them and do whatever you want to do yourself. The squad is also divided into two teams which you can give the orders \"Hold\" or \"Follow\" which comes in handy if you position one team to cover your six and take the rest with you into the fight. The health system is somewhat similar to games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas or Call of Duty. This means that there are no health packs scattered around. When you're hit you have to search for cover to regenerate. If you are hurt badly enough you'll go to the ground but as mentioned Ross and Rawlings can bring you back to life. The game only ends if you can't be healed fast enough or both Ross and Rawlings are dead."

Renwick for example is an ex-cop which is rather balanced in the skills speed, strength and stamina. Once the decision has been made, the tournament needs to be chosen. Set for example in a Stahlwerk in Germany, each tournament consists of six rounds. Each round has a different objective. The sprint challenge for example requires the player to race to the exit before time runs out. The siege challenge instead requires the player to survive for a certain amount of time in a limited space. But all challenges have one thing in common: The player looks at his character's back and shoots his way through hordes of enemies. For each kill, the player gets points and builds up a combo-multiplier. How many points the player gets depends on how high the multiplier is, where he hit the enemy and if he performed a special action before the kill like breaking through a door or jumping through a window. Each kill increases the multiplier by one but if the player waits too long between kills, it decreases. The higher it was at the last kill, the faster it will decrease. The game also features 8 different multiplayer-modes. These include normal Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch as well as modes like Team Fox Hunt in which the teams need to kill the fox of the enemy team in order to win."

The curse has been passed down through the generations in his family to the first born, starting with his great great grandfather. Jackie is about to be taken out by the henchmen of Mafia don Paulie Franchetti when the curse grants him supernatural powers. He is able to eliminate the hit men and goes after Paulie next, as the Mafia don wants to kill his girlfriend Jenny Romano. The game offers a mixture of classic first-person shooting with regular weapons, along with the powers of The Darkness. The latter cannot be used in well-lit environments. In dark areas, Jackie can combine both powers. Jackie can switch back and forth during gameplay, and as The Darkness, the viewpoint is placed lower, but with a broader point-of-view. Darkness powers allow Jackie to summon darklings (different types of creatures), summon dark tentacles that grow from his back to break through barriers and smash opponents, along with maw tentacles for close combat. Estacado can also create a black hole and force it to collapse on itself for wide-range damage, and summon darkness guns that fire lightning bolts. The game takes place in a modern environment, but also in the fictional Otherworld and Hell. The Darkness manifests itself as a voice in Jackie's head and tries to gain complete control of the body. The force feeds on the dark and requires a live human body to exist."

Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast. Fight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles.  There are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again. Manipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness. In King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins. The Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up. While the Chrono Grenades come in the three flavors and slow down, forward or rewind time in the area of the blast. The Time Shield not only makes you immune to time manipulation but also slows down every foreign object in a specific area which is good for dodging enemy fire. The Time Resistance power-up grants immunity against all time effects for a short period of time."

Go through the four chapters with branching paths and kill all the zombies, avoid killing the humans, and rescue the girl. Shooting various special targets along the way or in a certain time period give the player temporary health and weapon upgrades. The Saturn version of the game contains two extra modes called Saturn Mode and Boss Mode. Saturn mode plays like the arcade game, but offers the player different characters to choose from. Character selection matters since they each have varying attributes such as their reload time and how much damage they can take before dying. The Boss Mode allows the player to fight one boss of their choosing or all of the game's four boss monsters consecutively."

Players use the stylus to point at oncoming zombies on the bottom screen. Pointing fires the weapon Steiner has equipped. Shots can be delivered to the head, arms, legs, and stomach. To reload, players must simply grab a clip icon (located in the bottom right hand corner of the touch screen), and drag it to the bottom left hand corner which has an image of the 'magazine'. The D-pad and face buttons of the console are simply used to switch weapons. Both serve the same purpose, and work for both right-handed and left-handed players. Health and ammunition can be recovered by shooting crates and cabinets. The player also has the option of shooting switches to open doors and choose a left or right path when a fork appears. Either path chosen will still yield the same bonuses."

Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun. The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items."

Set in 1870, you are Colton White, a young gunslinger whose father is killed by an Indian tribe led by Reverend Reed. Just before passing away, your father hands you a token and reveals you are not his son. Sworn to avenge his death, you pursue the killers and unravel the secrets surrounding the item. Although you are on your own, temporary alliances can be formed with townspeople, Apaches, and posse members, but watch your back as they can turn against you. The main storyline, written by Hollywood screenwriter Randall Jahnson (The Mask of Zorro, 1998,) is linear. You will have to fight duels, defend towns against bandits, help build railway tracks, intervene in various conflicts, and kill heavily-armed bossed. There are also many side missions or alternative ways to earn money. You can play poker in the casino, help out farmers with their livestock, assist the local sheriff, or deliver items with the pony express. Other possibilities include bounty hunting, regular hunting for rare animals, mining for gold, and various rescue missions. The RPG elements involve acquiring and improving skills, such as QuickDraw (shown in Bullet Time,) Zoom Firing, Melee Combat, improved accuracy, the ability to throw axes, and strategically equipping and upgrading different weapons. There are hand weapons (knives, tomahawks, bayonets), archery arms, explosive throwable items, and regular guns, such as sharpshooter rifles, colts, and Winchesters. Some are earned during the missions, others can be bought and sold for cash in the towns. The GTA reference is reflected in the main means of transportation: horses. There are different animals to find with extensive movement options. Go on wild chases, spurt, gallop, do skid attacks, or trample your enemies. Give them some rest from time to time, or you will wear them down to death. In the melee combat, you can do roll maneuvers, use objects to provide cover, grab your opponents, and even scalp them. You are free to steer away from the main storyline and explore the giant landscape, with towns, deserts, mountains, wilderness, and caves."

The game is set one month after the events of the first game and takes place in the two cities Limassol and Kyrenia on the island of Cyprus. The Templars have moved there and Altaïr has followed them to find out what their plans are and to take all of them out if there is an opportunity. The main villain is Armand Bouchart, grand master of the Templars, who is hunting the apple of Eden, which will allow him to control the minds of anyone he chooses. Gameplay runs on similar vein to the original Assasin's Creed. Altaïr has the ability move freely through each of the cities in the familiar parkour style based on stealth and sneaking up on targets. Players can also opt to have Altaïr simply fight his way in at street level and go in through the front door. Altaïr's arsenal consists of his fists for melee (usually non-lethal) combat, his signature sleeve sword and a longsword. Bloodlines also features PS3 connectivity via USB, which allows you to unlock six new weapons in Assasin's Creed II when your PSP is hooked up to your PS3. These can also be used in the PSP version. In addition to this, any Templar coins you find in Bloodlines are carried over to Assassin's Creed II, and codex pages will give you a health boost."

Unlike the prior game, the game uses a 3D cell-shading technique making the game less realistic but more colorful, now spanning over 500 cards at your disposal. Gameplay is basically the same turn-based style as the original, though comes with certain enhancements like being able to undo your moves to a certain degree, or moving in real-time and not losing moves on opening doors or crouching. There is also a new type of cards that is self-triggered when you use other cards, usually enhancing your action in one way or another. The Metal Gear Ac!d 2 package comes with a Solid Eye, a special type of 3D glasses (a cardboard box that slides over the PSP, not the blue-purple plastic but with lenses) to play the game with a 3D effect. You can also use it to watch various Snake Eater and other movies as you unlock them in the game, giving you the feeling of 3D space."

As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy... The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences. Levels that have been visited before might become \"Expedition Missions\" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard."

The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character. Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot.

It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy. The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role. Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign.

You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills."

You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city. The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing. The title refers to working your way up the scene, as well as the \"Get In, Get Up, and Get Out\" principle - you need to gain access to restricted areas, get up on tall objects where your work can be seen, and get out afterwards without being caught. Good spots can be tracked using Intuition, and appear as coloured clouds. The game is conceived by clothing impresario Marc Ecko, founder of the suburban designer label Ecko and is intended to pay tribute to graffiti culture and its history.

        "daljsi_opis": "The game follows the story of a man named Jack Carver (voiced by Stephen Dorff). Carver is a former service member of the United States Navy, who was dishonorably discharged following a number of illegal actions. Afterwards, he sets up a shop in Manhattan and began supplying illegal arms to anyone and everyone, until a gang performed a hit using weapons supplied by Jack against a Mafia heir. Consequently, a price was put on his head by the Mob and he was forced to flee the United States and settle in Micronesia. Carver purchased a used boat from a government auction and spent his time ferrying tourists and diving clubs around the area. Eventually, a woman named Valerie Cortez shows up, offering a large sum if Jack would take her to a remote archipelago known as \"Jacutan\". Carver accepts, albeit with caution. Upon arriving at Jacutan, Cortez borrows a jet-ski from Jack and heads off on her own. Unworried, Jack decides to nap until she returns. When he awakes, Carver is startled to find UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying around his boat. They open fire on him, destroying his boat and force him to take cover inside a nearby wrecked Japanese aircraft carrier. At this point, the player assumes control. After a brief introduction level, the player acquires a headset and is directed by a mysterious voice who calls himself \"Doyle\". As it turns out, Cortez is part of the CIA and came to rescue Doyle. Doyle had been on a mission to expose the works of a mad scientist named Dr. Krieger. Krieger, along with his right-hand man, an ex-Apartheid officer named Colonel Richard Crowe, were attempting to develop a serum that would enhance the physical abilities of man and \"unlock\" hidden animal traits. Doyle convinces Carver to find and rescue Cortez, who has been captured by Crowe and his mercenaries. While covering Cortez, Carver himself is captured by Crowe on the orders of Doctor Krieger, who notes Carver's resourcefulness and tenacity and decided he would make a good test subject. Carver is injected with the serum and is to be transported to an observation area when he recovers prematurely and escapes and discovers, to his shock, that he has new \"feral abilities\", such as increased speed, night vision and a violent melee attack. Along with the feral powers comes an implant designed to regulate the serum's effects and allows for specialized weapons to be used against Carver. Doyle commands Carver to find his way to Doyle's position, so that the implant can be removed. Along the way, Carver has to prevent a mercenary computer programmer from deciphering a pocket PC that belongs to Cortez, which would, in turn, blow Doyle's cover. Descending into an old World War II-era Japanese bunker to stop the decryption, Jack is cornered by the mercenaries as he attempts to escape. He retreats through an old underground mining complex and follows Doyle's instructions to the main research facility. Carver then makes his way to the facility, where he discovers the extent of Krieger's work and the mutant monsters he has created. While in the facility, Carver discovers Crowe is gathering the mutants for an unknown purpose and then later, he finally meets with Doyle, who frees Carver from the implant. Upon having the implant removed, Jack begins to exhibit uncontrolled evolution; in game terms, the adrenaline cost for his abilities decreases and he gains the ability to carry and wield mounted weapons like the .50 caliber machine gun. As Jack escapes the research facility, he discovers that Crowe has taken Doyle and the mutant serum and has unleashed the mutants in a plot to betray Krieger. Jack must fight through the middle of a war between Crowe's mercenaries, the feral mutants and an elite group of special forces under Krieger's personal command, under orders to \"sanitize\" Crowe's troops. Rescuing Doyle, Carver discovers that Crowe has injected himself with a quadruple dose of the serum Jack received and without an implant. Assuming control of the \"Alpha\" creatures, the most powerful and intelligent mutants with abilities similar to Jack's own, Crowe has gone straight to Kreiger's base of operations. Jack follows and fights his way to Dr. Krieger's mansion atop an active volcano, where he battles and defeats the physically deformed Crowe. Krieger, in a last-ditch effort to use the Alphas against Jack, realizes that they now view Jack as their leader due to his victory over Crowe. The mutants turn on Dr. Krieger and kill him, viewing him as a threat to Jack, and thus allow him to escape as the volcano erupts. Jack is able to retreat onto a Black Hawk piloted by Cortez and Doyle, who promise to pay for a new boat to replace his destroyed one; Doyle also promises that they \"can do one better\" and slides a metal case to Jack, who opens it and laughs cryptically at the unseen contents as the helicopter flies away. The game includes subtle thematic elements relating to the dangers of genetic engineering and the genocide of local islanders, as can be seen by the deformed creatures created by Krieger. Also, a mysterious backdrop relating to dinosaurs is revealed via in-game radios that will sometimes carry programs that discuss the history of dinosaurs and the possibility that some might still be alive. This is further developed by appearance of lizard-like animals (which resemble small dinosaurs) that reside in the jungles on the island. The terrain in Far Cry: Instincts varies greatly. Set on a South Pacific archipelago, the landscape includes tropical rainforests, dense jungles, towering canyons, mines, swamps, and even volcanic forests."

The most ancient of evils has broken through into our world and is threatening to spread its taint across the whole of the earth unless it's stopped. At ground zero lies the Middle Eastern city of Al-Khali, a modern city built atop the ancient ruins of a dozen previous conquerors. All attempts of contacting the citizens of the city have failed. With tensions already running high in the region, this is just the sort of thing that could trigger the apocalypse...  In Clive Barker's Jericho, players assume the role of the leader of the Jericho Squad - a seven man Special Forces strike team that protects U.S. interests against paranormal threats. Each member of the squad is an expert in modern warfare as well as their own different para-psychological disciplines, including clairvoyance, alchemy, blood magic, exorcism, etc. Players must lead the Jericho Squad into the flaming ruins of the city, moving block by block towards the dimensional rift tearing away at its heart. Along the way, they encounter the horrific armies of hellish denizens that now rule the city and corrupt everything they touch. As players incrementally approach the source of evil, they will have to rely less and less on traditional weapons and instead focus on the combined psychic talents of the Jericho Squad."

The complete island is accessible from the beginning and you can either follow the main storyline, engage in side-missions, or collect items all over the place. To help the revolution you can also drive the government out of the individual sectors on the island. This is accomplished by a three-stages fight in which you have to go up against a huge army of government forces. As a fully trained agent, Rico can also perform many stunts. He has always an parachute equipped which he can open whenever he has enough speed. So he often uses cars or bikes as a jump-pad and then sails smoothly into the sunset. But of course he cannot impress the evil regime with that, so he also has access to a wide range of weapons from pistols with unlimited ammo to rocket launchers and machine guns.

Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of \"Citadel space\". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the \"First Contact War\" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization. Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various planets, moons and other destinations."

Initially the many different races of the world lived in peace, a power granted by mythical orb which created the world. However, the orb is mysteriously shattered which leads the different races (humans, elves, orcs, goblins, and more) to distrust each other and eventually leads to the giant, unnamed battle. Throughout the game you control seven different characters, each of which provide a different perspective on the battle. Some parts of each characters story overlap allowing a different point of view while other parts are unique. Initially only one character is available, and by progressing through the game the additional characters will be unlocked; in order to see the complete story you will need to complete all of the scenarios for each character. Each scenario in the game is a large scale battle involving hundreds of opponents to defeat; each character you control has a variety of moves available and as you level up additional moves become available. The varying maneuvers available are performed by pressing different button combos on the controller. As you defeat enemies red orb crystals are earned which fill a meter; when the orb meter is finally full you are able to perform a more powerful attack capable of taking out many foes. While performing this attack you earn blue orb crystals which fill up a second meter; when that meter is full you have one of your most powerful attacks available to you.  Since you will be fighting a significant number of enemies at one time you don't enter battle alone; two groups of warrior guard units fight with you. At the beginning of each mission you can choose the type of guard units to bring with you, such as archers who specialize in long range attacks or the infantry who are better at close range combat. You also have the ability to give them some simple commands such as calling the guards to your side for protection or attacking a target. As you progress through the missions, different items can be found. These include more powerful weapons, improved armor, or magical items which increase your hit points or decrease damage received. After each mission a new mission will become available on the world map; you have the option of playing or replaying any of the missions which are unlocked on the map which allows you to level up on easier missions if you have trouble defeating one of the tougher ones."

You can simply buy equipment by using the Y button on your controller in conjunction with the left thumbstick button to select an item to buy. As such, the game developers call The Outfit \"destruction on demand\". The equipment you buy with Field Units will initially be occupied by AI-controlled soldiers, but you can replace whoever is using the equipment so that you can have some fun blowing stuff up. Sporting a fully destructible environment, almost everything in The Outfit can be blown up. You can play as one of three characters. Tommy Mac can take lots of damage before dying, and comes equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, but equipment will cost him more Field Units than other characters. Deuce Williams comes equipped with a rocket launcher and pistol, and doesn't need as much Field Units to buy stuff as Tommy does, but he isn't nearly as strong as Tommy. JD Tyler is the most accurate of the three, sporting a sniper rifle and shotgun, but unfortunately he will die with one shot, so he must take an extremely tactical approach to gameplay."

The game follows the story of the movie of the same name detailing the background of Logan aka Wolverine before he joined the X-Men. Starting on the last mission of the elite military force known as Team X, the player witnesses Kayla's death, escapes from Weapon Factory X with his new reinforced skeleton and ultimately helps Wolverine to have his revenge on Victor Creed aka Sabretooth. In between dozens of enemies including a few boss fight require extensive use of the famous steel blades. Wolverine makes use of several different combos and finishers while slashing through his enemies converting his normal light and hard attacks into serious damage. Often it's even possible to incorporate the environment into the cause of death of an enemy by throwing him onto a spike or something similarly hurtful. The player has also access to four Fury Attacks. These attacks are very powerful but require rage in order to be executed. Rage on the other hand is collected simply by killing enemies. In addition the game makes use of Quick Time Events to unfold scripted cinematic sequences. By killing enemies Logan gains experience points (including a multiplier if he defeats them in rapid succession) as well as by finding dog tags hidden on dead soldiers around the levels. Once he has gained enough experience Wolverine advances a level, gaining not only more health but also skill points. These can then be used to learn new combos or increase the strength of already known ones. Besides the dog tags, Wolverine's old suits from the comics are hidden in the levels. Finding all of them unlocks bonus challenges and allows the player to use the corresponding suit in the normal game."

The Blackhand Edition adds a second path that the player may take through the game, that of the operator. The main method of progression is by blackmailing police, the FBI or members of other families, and what the player does or says affects the outcome. While the enforcer's goal is to destroy the other families through brute force, the operator's is to blackmail the police chiefs of the five boroughs by finding enough \"dirt\" on them during missions. The player then blackmails the chiefs, enabling the bribe gauge to fill to the top for free every time the player talks to the chief, effectively allowing the player to take control of the police in that area. The police fight alongside the player's family members and can also arrest or kill rival family members. The path of the operator also grants the player additional tactical abilities that are not open to the enforcer, such as enhanced and regenerating health, the ability to call in the four-man hit squad twice as often, enhanced crew damages and health, ability to plant car bombs and make instant stealth kills, and reduced price on bribing on the police and FBI."

The game's title is derived from the name of High Rock's capital city. The main protagonist travels to Daggerfall at the request of the emperor Uriel Septim. His mission involves freeing the ghost of the late King Lysandus. Apparently, a letter concerning the king and sent by the emperor to the court in Daggerfall contains information about a dangerous ancient power. It is now up to the hero to retrieve the letter, reveal the dark secret that has been preserved in the king's family, and eventually discover the key to the resurrection of an iron golem who wields immense power. Like its predecessor, Daggerfall is an open-ended role-playing game, in which the main quest is but a small fraction of the various missions and assignments the player is able to undertake. The game is notable for breaking records concerning the size of its world (though much of it has been generated randomly). Interaction with hundreds of thousands of non-playable characters is possible. The player is free to join one of the many political and social organizations of Tamriel, as well as pursue a personal quest for power. The player is able to buy houses, ships, and horses, as well as become a werewolf, a vampire, or a wereboar. Combat in Daggerfall is action-based: the player uses the mouse to determine the direction and the power of sword swings and shots from a ranged weapon. Character growth is handled somewhat similarly to that of Quest for Glory games: the more the player performs an action, the better the protagonist becomes at it. For example, swinging the sword will eventually increase the player character's attack power and skill with that weapon, etc. This extends to non-combat activities such as jumping, bartering, speaking foreign languages, etc. Leveling up occurs when several main and secondary skills have been raised sufficiently. During character generation the player is given the option to create and name his or her custom classes by combining attributes and skills."

        "daljsi_opis": "The plot of Lord of the Rings: War in the North takes place within the time frame of the events experienced in J. R. R. Tolkien's books as well as the series of films from Peter Jackson. While the adventure in this game intertwines with that of Frodo and the Fellowship, it primarily takes place in other areas of the Middle Earth map. The player's character and two companions (which can be either computer controlled or co-op controlled with two friends) serve to support Frodo's grand quest by battling Sauron's \"General\" and his minions in the north. The adventure and that of the main story from Lord of the Rings overlap at certain points and there is definitely a connection, but the player does not control any of the main characters from the original story. The three canonical character types are available to play, Eradan the (human male) ranger, Andriel the (elf female) mage, and Farin the (dwarf male) warrior. One of the three predefined characters is selected at the start of the game. There is no character creation, but within the game is an option to tweak the look by using mirrors in certain locations. Also at certain locations it is possible to switch to one of the other two characters to control or simply continuing on as the character that was started with. Each character can be played as a range fighter or a melee fighter, or a combination of the two. The events are entirely linear, with the path set out before you with obvious goals and quests. It is not an open world game that can be freely explored and were the given quests can be ignored. The game is segmented into areas that are accessed by clicking on the place name on the map screen. Many of them have central hubs for resting, trading, shopping and acquiring new quests. The gameplay largely revolves around fighting creatures. Each area is filled with orcs, goblins, spiders, trolls, and other minions of Sauron. Melee fighting is handled with a combination of standard hits and special moves. It is also possible to block and dodge (rolling). Range fighting is handled in the same way. The two companions use their own set of skills to assist in the battle and can be instructed by the player in the solo mode. Characters can be upgraded with new abilities through the game and there are often conversations with different options, but with no moral ramifications. Each character class has unique abilities such as mining gems and destroying walls for the dwarf for instance."

The story focuses on three characters, Zoë Castillo, April Ryan, and Kian Alvane, who live in two parallel worlds: technologically advanced Stark and magical Arcadia. April was the protagonist of the first game, while the other two are new characters. The main storyline follows Zoë, a Stark resident whose investigation of her ex-boyfriend's disappearance and other mysterious occurrences lead her to April. Meanwhile in Arcadia, April battles the villainous Empire of Azadi while Kian, an elite Azadi soldier, is sent to assassinate her.

The player controls one of two characters - Narcotics detective Jack Forezenski (voiced by Michael Madsen), or D.E.A. agent Marcus Hill (voiced by Bill Belamy). Both are led by Narcotics chief Joe Kowalski (voiced by Ron Pearlman), and the player switches between the two as the story unfolds. As an undercover cop, players are free to roam the streets and dispense justice at their discretion. Aside from storyline missions, players can encounter 12 types of randomized street crimes and stop them to boost their \"badge rating\" (loosely, a measure of their trust within the police). Players can likewise flash their badge around to cause perps to surrender or run. Criminals that resist must be beaten in a small \"struggle\" minigame to get cuffed. Players can also arrest alleyway drug dealers and deposit their drugs safely at the station. Alternatively, the player can beat up drug dealers for their cash and stash, then sell the drugs to civilians for income. The player can also use the drugs themselves for temporary beneficial effects (ecstasy keeps enemies from attacking, speed makes you run and shoot faster, etc.) at the cost of badge points and the potential to become addicted. Excessive use of force against innocent civilians, or selling drugs to other undercover cops, result in major losses of badge points."

In the darkness, the evil has power... but add light and they can be defeated. Will they survive the night ahead?

Ammunition is specific for each gun or pistol and is not interchangeable. Weapons can be swapped between characters and ammunition found is stored in the group's reserves for sharing amongst them."

Released on March 18, 2003, the Rainbow Six video game series is based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel of the same name. Based on the Unreal Engine 2.0, Raven Shield is a tactical shooter with realistic properties. Raven Shield moved toward mainstream first-person shooters like Counter-Strike, adapting various features absent in previous versions. These included the ability to see one's weapon while in first-person view, many new weapons and upgrades (including larger magazines and sights), and a redesigned multiplayer. A console version, entitled Rainbow Six 3, was developed for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Nintendo GameCube. This iteration of the game features the same basic engine, models, textures, and artwork, but with significantly different game mechanics, gameplay, and storyline. A port was also released on Mac OS X on December 19, 2003. Due to the console version's success on the Xbox and the popularity of its subscription-based online multiplayer service, Xbox Live, an Xbox-exclusive semi-sequel was released in 2004 titled Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow. The next full game in the Rainbow Six series, Rainbow Six: Lockdown, was released in 2005."

Surviving as a bounty hunter in the rough-and-tumble Old West, Red stays ever watchful for some clue that could lead him to the men who murdered his father and mother -- and then one day, that clue appears. Step into Red's spurred boots, and take up his mission of revenge. Red Dead Revolver features environments and artistry inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns films, mixed with third-person shooter gameplay similar to that of Max Payne. The gameplay and story proceed linearly through stages, including several levels in which you play as different characters (a British trick shooter, a female rancher, a renegade Mexican general, a stealthy native warrior, and a Buffalo Soldier). Each character has his own signature move: for instance, Red's \"Dead-Eye\" slows down time and allows you to set up targets for a rapid \"fan fire\" takedown, while General Diego's flare rifle lets you specify a target for bombardment by Diego's cannons. Beating each level will earn you reward money (and chaining together many limb shots and multiple kills will earn you bonus money). You can spend your cash on unlockable characters (for the multiplayer game), journal entries that offer backstory and character info, or an array of canonical Old West weaponry, including pistols, rifles, and shotguns of many varieties, as well as knives, molotovs, poison and dynamite. The game features pistol dueling with certain boss characters, as a mini-game mechanic in which you time your draw to an opportune moment and prepare targets as you raise your gun. There is also a multiplayer game (split-screen only, not networked), which you can play with friends and/or AI bots. Multiplayer incorporates a wide array of powerups, an alternative dueling showdown mode, and two kinds of optional poker sub-games (based on stud or Texas Hold 'Em) that mix some strategy into the action."

Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons. Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested.

It was developed by Croteam and was released on October 11, 2005. The game was initially published by 2K Games, a Take-Two Interactive subsidiary. The game was later made available on Steam on January 31, 2012. While the game was originally released only for Windows and the Xbox, an unoffcial Linux version of the game was created and is being handled by Linux Installers for Linux Gamers. In the single-player campaign, the player assumes the role of hero Sam \"Serious\" Stone in his adventures against the forces of the extraterrestrial overlord, \"Mental\", who seeks to destroy humanity. Taking place after the events of Serious Sam: The Second Encounter, Sam travels through various worlds collecting parts of a medallion in an effort to defeat Mental. He is guided by the Sirian Great Council and receives sporadic aid from the natives of the worlds he visits. The multiplayer mode includes online co-op and deathmatch, the latter having been introduced in a patch. A 4.5/5.0 was awarded to Serious Sam by Computer Gaming World, though overall the game received moderate praise from the media, earning an average of 75% on Game Rankings. Croteam simultaneously developed Serious Engine 2, the successor to their previous game engine, Serious Engine, for use in the game, and the engine is capable of many features of other advanced game engines of the time including high dynamic range rendering and light bloom. The engine supports integration with both Xfire and GameSpy Arcade for multiplayer match finding. Serious Sam 2 is the only game so far to use the proprietary engine, though the Serious Engine 2 is available for licensing."

The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black-robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase \"Shadow, the final destroyer\". Laura's compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below. In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery. D-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos. Horrifying monsters will attack randomly (or serve as boss fights at specific points of the plot), at which point the player is taken to a separate combat screen. Laura must dispatch of the enemies by rapidly shooting at them, in a way not dissimilar to the shooting sequences of Snatcher. Enemies can attack from different sides, so the player often has to turn around and quickly react to their attacks. Laura's default gun is weak, but uses unlimited ammunition; stronger guns with limited ammo can be found by exploring the surroundings. Laura receives experience points for defeating enemies and eventually levels up, becoming stronger and having her hit points increased."

Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash. The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions. Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army. New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns."

The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value. Left 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009. The popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions."

It released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in October 2010. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic, open world environment around the area of Nevada, California, and Arizona. The player takes control of the character known as the Courier, who, preceding the start of the game, is hired by a delivery service to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip. The game starts during the delivery, where the Courier is intercepted, shot in the head, and left for dead by a mysterious man who steals the package. After being found by a friendly robot, Victor, and healed by a man named Doc Mitchell, the Courier is thrust back into the desert to seek revenge and recover the stolen package. By doing this, the player becomes caught between various factions competing for control over the desert and its most valuable asset, the Hoover Dam, ultimately coming to shape the future of its inhabitants. Even though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 in order of Fallout game releases, offers a similar action role-playing experience, and shares its engine and legacy content with Fallout 3, New Vegas is not a direct sequel. It marks the return of some elements found in Fallout 2. The game was a critical and commercial success, shipping more than 5 million copies altogether. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold almost 12 million copies worldwide."

He is an engineer who previously fought the hideous \"Necromorphs\" - a race of polymorphic (shape-changing) parasitic extraterrestrials that feed off of dead tissue and use dead corpses as hosts - aboard the doomed \"PlanetCracker\", the space ship USG Ishimura. Three years after those events, Clarke is found derelict in space and brought aboard The Sprawl - a massive space station orbiting Titan, one of the moons of Saturn. Isaac is understandably traumatized by the events of the first game and is haunted by memories of his girlfriend Nicole's suicide, the horrific and numerous shapes and forms of the Necromorph horde, and continued delusions of an apparition taking Nicole's form. While being psycho-analyzed on The Sprawl, a new Necromorph outbreak soon occurs and Isaac has no choice to escape. He runs from both the Necromorphs and the space station's security team while trying to find a way out of his bonds, grabs a gun, and then learns the truths behind the reappearance of the Necromorphs and the appearance of yet another Marker, all while fighting dementia and even more hideous beasts than before. Dead Space 2 looks and plays almost exactly like its predecessor. Players control Isaac using a third-person camera. Isaac carries a weapon in hand and must aim the weapon before it can be fired. Each weapon has an alternate attack and players are once again given the ability to use Stasis to slow down objects or enemies, as well as use the telekinesis module to grab and fling objects or solve environmental puzzles. Like before, Necromorphs are extremely tough and resilient to standard shots. The best way to kill them is through dismemberment. Various types of Necromorphs react differently to being dismembered and the player must learn the most efficient way to take each different type apart. He also can use dismembered limbs, such as blade-like arms or one particular species' explosive sack, as weapons that can be flung with telekinesis all the while saving some precious ammo. Isaac can now also control his movement when in zero-gravity and fly around, instead of just jumping from platform to platform. This provides more room for exploration and new possibilities in such areas."

There, they set up the Animus for Desmond to explore deeper into Ezio's past and discover more about the missing Pieces of Eden. Ezio's story takes place immediately after the end of Assassin's Creed II, and has him leaving Rome to head back to Monteriggioni. There, he is ambushed and the Piece of Eden he has found is stolen. He must head back to Rome, which has since been seized by the Borgia, rescue its people, and recover what has been lost. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues the story from Assassin's Creed II. Players take on the role of Ezio as they use their assassin skills to liberate Rome and fight against the Templars. Players take on missions to progress the story, earn money, and gradually free the city from the influence of the Borgia. Specifically, by burning down the thirteen Borgia towers that are being used to enforce their rule, Ezio can reclaim areas of Rome back for the people, and use his money to restore shops, shortcut tunnels, and even Roman landmarks. By doing this, players also earn a regular income from Rome, which they can claim from any of Rome's banks. New to the Assassin's Creed series is a multiplayer component. The backstory behind the multiplayer mode is that Abstergo, the Templar organization, is using Animus devices to train their recruits to become Assassins. You take on the role of an Abstergo recruit, and must find and assassinate your target while being tracked for assassination yourself. You must make sure that you do not arouse suspicion, otherwise it will become obvious that you are an assassin rather than a citizen, making it easier for you to be spotted and taken down.

The game was first released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November and December 2010, and was later made available on Microsoft Windows in March and June 2011. The story is set in a fictional history of real world events set in two time periods, the 16th and 21st centuries. The main portion of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to prevent the 2012 apocalypse. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Ezio's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Ezio is able to freely explore 16th-century Rome to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game introduced a multiplayer component to the series, portrayed as a Templar training program. The game received critical acclaim along with multiple awards including a BAFTA award for Best Action Game. It was followed in November 2011 by Assassin's Creed: Revelations, a direct sequel that served as a conclusion to Ezio's story and continued the story of Desmond Miles."

Survivors offer rewards for locating missing family members and scavenging items, but also trivial tasks such as returning a teddy bear. There are main quests that further the overall story divided in different chapters, as well as many optional sidequests. The island can be explored on foot or by driving a vehicle. The gameplay is violent and action-focused. Even though many encounters can be avoided by outrunning zombies, the player is always encouraged to take on the opposition."

He was working on a secret weapon codenamed Aurora. But before the commandos could escape the island, Japan activated Aurora and killed everyone. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 takes place in the present day after the events in Battlefield: Bad Company. The four members of B-Company, better known as Bad Company, Privates Preston Marlowe, Terrence Sweetwater, George Haggard, and Sergeant Samuel Redford are sent behind Russian enemy lines to secure a device related to Aurora. But although they managed to escape Russian soldiers and completed their supposedly final mission, the device turns out to be a fake. Consequently Army General Braidwood assigns them to a special operation of stopping Aurora. The fairly linear single player campaign puts the player into the shoes of Private Preston Marlowe, sending him off to uncover the mysteries surrounding Aurora in a typical first-person-shooter-fashion. On the side of the other members of Bad Company, the player tries to fulfill the various objectives of the missions while gunning down several dozens enemies using a huge arsenal of real-world military equipment but limited to only carrying two main weapons and a side-arm at the same time. During the course of the game, the player unlocks new weapons by finding them during his missions, granting him the ability to equip them from then on at every supply drop. As in previous installments of the Battlefield series, the core of the game is again the class-based and team-based multiplayer for up to 32 players, divided into squads with four men each. Four game modes are available: Rush, Conquest, Squad-Rush and Squad-Deathmatch. Each mode can also be played on \"Hardcore\"-difficulty, deactivating the cross-hair, the mini-map and such."

In the game players take on the role of \"War,\" one of the dreaded Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. But things are not as they were. Once the unstoppable and just wielder of divine retribution, War is now reduced in stature and cast out among the ruined lands of the Earth that he himself devastated. All that remains is the search for the truth behind his betrayal and the survival of its consequences.  Deceived by the forces of evil into prematurely bringing about the end of the world, War stands accused of breaking the sacred law by inciting a war between heaven and hell. Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell."

Powered by the Frostbite 2 engine, Battlefield 3 aims to provide the fast paced, team oriented online multiplayer the series has made its name upon while also providing the first true single player campaign in a numbered Battlefield game, and for the first time in any Battlefield game numbered or not is a cooperative mode. The game also introduces the Battlelog feature, an in browser service which gives in-depth statistics for individual soldiers such as their Win/Lose ratio, their favourite weapon, how accurate they are - and so forth. Battlelog also allows players to create Platoons which are not unlike clans which track the stats of a combined group, allows for scrimmaging, voice communications, and parties which will attempt to bundle friends and platoon members into squads together if possible. The game is also launched from Battlelog although settings are altered in game. The campaign is set in the not-too-distant future of 2014, in which players take on the role of Staff sergeant Henry Blackburn and occasionally other members of his 5 man squad. For the majority of the story, Blackburn is being interrogated about knowledge of an attack on New York and as such the missions take place in a disjointed, flashback fashion as Blackburn recounts his encounter with the PLR - a dangerous terrorist organization who may be after chemical and nuclear weapons. The campaign plays like most other shooters, as the player uses various weapons to dispatch enemies and push to the end of each scenario often aided with AI companions. The campaign does offer some variety though, occasionally allowing the player to ride inside tanks, jets, and helicopters - but unlike multiplayer, it is rare that the player gets a chance to actually drive these vehicles. The multiplayer suite contains Conquest, the classic Battlefield mode in which teams compete to control various points on a map and drain the enemy teams tickets - Rush, in which attackers attempt to destroy M-Com stations and the defenders must dwindle their tickets to 0 to win, Team Deathmatch which is self explanatory, and a Squad based variation of Rush and Deathmatch in which individual squads try to take the M-Com Stations for themselves or wipe out other squads. Like in past Battlefield games, there are multiple classes. The Assault class uses assault rifles and carries medic kits and defibrillators to heal and revive teammates, respectively. The Support class uses light machine guns and carry Ammo packs to resupply teammates and C4 which can be used to destroy tanks or crumble buildings. The Engineer class uses sub-machine guns, has a blow torch for repairing vehicles and a rocket launcher for destroying them. Lastly, the Recon class carries long range rifles and uses motion detectors and mobile spawn points to detect enemies and allow friendlies to spawn anywhere on the map. All classes can unlock new gadgets and specializations, each weapon also has an unlock tree that unlocks weapon specific items based on how often and how well that particular weapon has been used. The same applies to vehicles, which consist of tanks, IFVs, Armored personnel carriers, hummers, jeeps, helicopters and returning from Battlefield 2 are Jets."

As with previous Call of Duty games, the player will switch between different characters engaged in operations around the globe that include Vietnam, Russia, Cuba and Laos. The two primary characters are soldiers Alex Mason and CIA agent Jason Hudson, members of the black ops group known as the Studies and Observations Group (SOG), who have been tasked with investigating and dealing with the Nova-6, an experimental Soviet chemical weapon.

Returning from Treyarch's previous Call of Duty outing, World at War is a zombie co-op mode that allows two players to play together offline and four players online. Players will be able to earn CoD Points, which are awarded as the player earns XP, with CoD Points being awarded at a rate of 1 for every 10XP earned. These can then be put on bets on special 'wager matches', which if won gives the player additional CoD Points and XP. A new feature in Black Ops is the Create a Class 2.0, which allows players to more extensively customize their multiplayer character, including dog tags, camo patterns, emblem and gun sight reticules.

The player once again takes on the role of various characters throughout the campaign, including 'Soap' McTavish from the previous game, as well as several new ones, including Frost and Sandman, members of the US Delta Force. Next to the main story campaign with its scripted gameplay, MW3 features two cooperative game modes. The first is Spec Ops, making a return from the previous game. It has the players perform brief missions and a star is awarded based on the performance. The second is the new Survival Mode, where players fight off different waves of enemy soldiers which get progressively harder. The multiplayer portion comes with the usual game modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, ...). In addition to these, several new game modes have been included. The first is called Kill Confirmed and requires the player to retrieve the dog tags of defeated enemies for the kill to register. The opposing team can also retrieve it to deny the player's kill. Another one, Team Defender, involves teams capturing a single flag on the map and keeping it for as long as possible to score the most points. There are also several pre-made modes for private matches, such as Infection (kill enemies to recruit them), Drop Zone (hold a zone for points and care packages), Team Juggernaut (each team has an AI Juggernaut character), and Gun Game (every player only has a pistol and three bullets, and earns extra guns and bullets by getting kills). The Killstreak reward system from the previous games for multiplayer has been scrapped in favor of the new Pointstreak system. Points are earned by completing additional challenges, next to just raking in kills.

An ideological war is growing between people who accept the biotechnological progress and people who fight it. A human revolution is coming. Adam Jensen is a thirty-four-year-old ex-SWAT member from Detroit, enrolled by a powerful biotechnology company named Sarif Industries. His job is to ensure the scientists' private security and safeguard the secrets of the company's projects. The first day after his hiring, Adam Jensen is about to attend a meeting with David Sarif, the founder and CEO of Sarif Industries, when suddenly a red alert is issued in the company laboratories. A troop of mercenaries, apparently working for Belltower Associates, breaks in and kills several scientists. After having neutralized some of the mercenaries, Adam is severely injured by one of them. He has no choice but to be enhanced with biomechanical augmentations to save his life. His goal is now to discover what were the motivations of the attackers, and unravel a greater conspiracy behind their actions. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the third game in the Deus Ex series. The events of the game take place in the year 2027, twenty-five years before those described in the first game. Like the first installment, the game is a hybrid of 3D shooter with a stealth angle and role-playing. All styles of play can be adopted to succeed in the missions, from a totally furtive mode (some bonuses are granted in case the player character hasn't been detected during the whole mission), to the most brutal one. The player's decisions may have an impact on the storyline. The game offers a vast array of weapons and biomechanical augmentations (hacking, social, stealth, sight, armor or combat skill enhancements, etc.). Various amounts of experience points are awarded for completing main or secondary quests, avoiding or eliminating enemies, hacking, reading electronic books and discovering secret passages. After having accumulated a certain quantity of experience points, the player is awarded a \"praxis kit\", which can be manually used to learn or improve an augmentation. These kits can also be found during exploration or purchased in clinics. Role-playing elements include, besides augmentations and general character-building, exploration of non-hostile areas and dialogue with non-playable characters. During certain crucial moments the player will have to participate in a \"conversation battle\" with a key character, selecting the correct psychological approach and influencing subsequent plot events. A few modifications have been made to the shooting gameplay, emphasizing its tactical aspect. Third-person cover system is integrated into otherwise fully first-person gameplay. Enemies often appear in groups led by a commander; taking out the latter may demoralize enemies, making them easier targets.

When the crisis became serious, a synthetic drug called \"Zombrex\" which delays the zombification was released by the pharmaceutical company Phenotrans and sold out quickly. The player takes control over Chuck Greene, a former national motocross champion fleeing to Fortune City, rebuilt from the remains of old Las Vegas and yet untouched by the zombie disease, along with his daughter Katey. Katey was bitten by her zombified mother and thus needs a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours to avoid zombification. In order to get his hands on more Zombrex - or at least the money to buy some - Chuck is desperate enough to enter a game show called \"Terror Is Reality\" where he has to slay the undead for entertainment. Right after the show some of his \"victims\" break loose into the city, causing a wide-scale infection. Chuck learns from a news report that he is accused of causing the outbreak and that the military will come to capture him and to purge the city in three days. Like the first Dead Rising, the bulk of the game takes place over 72 hours, but once the player has completed all of the 'cases' (small sections of story that comprise the games objectives), Overtime Mode will be unlocked and adds extra time and objectives. During the initial 72 hours, Chuck must get Katey more Zombrex, find a way to escape Fortune City and clear his name of wrong doing whilst making sure him and Katey survive. Gameplay takes place in a sandbox-like environment. The player can freely move around in zombie-infested Fortune City and choose how they want the game to progress by either taking on missions (plot-related and side missions, the latter mostly include saving survivors from zombies) or ignoring them. The player can ignore the main story altogether, letting all survivors die, and just fight the undead roaming the streets or go exploring. This will not result in a \"game over\" screen, but in a different ending. If the player fails to get Katey a shot of Zombrex every 24 hours, the game won't end either (unlike Dead Rising 2: Case 0). If the Story Mode is cleared with the true ending (which requires to complete all plot-related missions, the so-called \"case files\"), Overtime Mode will be unlocked, extending the main plot."

        "daljsi_opis": "In an attempt to save Earth, Raiden began a war with Shinnok, a fallen Elder God, and his minions; a decision that cost many people their lives. The battle raged on for thousands of years and many tournaments were held to find out who was the strongest combatant. The winner would then face the ultimate challenge of defeating one of Shinnok's disciples. After the Earth warriors were successful in overcoming his strongest adversary, the evil god Shao Kahn escaped the Netherealm for one last-ditch effort at world supremacy. Mortal Kombat 4 (straight from the arcades) is back sporting a 3D engine and new features in the gory fighting franchise. Each character (15 selectable) comes equipped with their own unique maneuvers, fatalities, and weapons. That's right, weapons. Fujin, for example, shoots his foes with a crossbow while Sub Zero cools opponents down with an ice scepter. Not only can each character's weapon be dropped and picked up by his or her opponent, projectiles straight out of the fighting arena can be used. Players can pick up rocks and other objects and beat their opponents senseless. The backgrounds and arenas are totally interactive, meaning anything you can see (in the immediate fighting area) can be picked up and used in combat. An assortment of gameplay options are available, including Arcade (1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. 2 Kombat), Team, Endurance, Tournament, and Practice. The Arcade version is the actual game -- choose your character and destiny (four different difficulty levels) and mount an assault against the various characters and Shinnok himself. In the Endurance mode, you can test your skill based on how well you hold up to a barrage of opponents. The Ultimate Endurance option keeps track of your statistics and gives out a \"Kombat\" rating. Mortal Kombat 4 comes equipped with a cheat code entry system, where you can find a code, enter it, and watch what happens. The developers also included extra characters, game options, and other bonuses not included in the original arcade version."

These rabid creatures were easily provoked and resistant to conventional attack. Eight specimens were encountered in the region now referred to as \"Ground:ALPHA\"... Only four were successfully contained for study. Victims of the attack were quarantined at a research facility nearby. These victims displayed signs of internal liquefaction and accelerated necrosis, similar to symptoms of other flesh-eating viruses native to that region. But it wasn't a viral outbreak. It was a parasitic infestation. A previously unidentified species of hook worm was found beneath the skin of the Ground: ALPHA specimens. These parasites, we call them \"Alpha-worms\", laid dozens of eggs inside their hosts, which in turn produced numerous larvae. These larvae penetrated the bloodstream and triggered a variety of genetic failures. However, unlike most genetic failures, these symptoms were not fatal. Instead, infested victims were larger, stronger… and driven by hunger. Using the research gained from the Ground: ALPHA specimens, a team of some special individuals were assembled. Minor outbreaks occurred over the next few years, but elite squad quickly put them down. Which brings us to the current situation in Tokyo...

Whether Woo was intimately involved in guiding Stranglehold or more of a watchful father, his influence can be felt in every frame. Midway has managed to capture the essence of a Woo film -- in some ways more than Woo has over the past decade. You get everything a fan could ask for: excessive gunplay, heavily stylized cinematic moments, melodrama, slow-motion dives, dual-fisted pistols, and, of course, doves aplenty. Some have called Woo's films a beautiful ballet of violence. Stranglehold is less ballet and more a mosh pit of bullets. Either way, lots of people die and little in the environment is left standing once the smoke clears.  The spiritual successor to one of Woo's most popular films, Stranglehold puts you in the shoes of famed Inspector Tequila. Chow Yun Fat comes stateside to reprise his role (though this time in English), adding a level of authenticity. The story is convoluted -- something about a kidnapped girl, a dead cop, and drug money. The cut-scenes are sometimes dripping with melodrama. But that's a good thing. Melodrama is a John Woo signature move and, like so much in Stranglehold, it helps immerse gamers in the world of Hard Boiled."

Renwick for example is an ex-cop which is rather balanced in the skills speed, strength and stamina. Once the decision has been made, the tournament needs to be chosen. Set for example in a Stahlwerk in Germany, each tournament consists of six rounds. Each round has a different objective. The sprint challenge for example requires the player to race to the exit before time runs out. The siege challenge instead requires the player to survive for a certain amount of time in a limited space. But all challenges have one thing in common: The player looks at his character's back and shoots his way through hordes of enemies. For each kill, the player gets points and builds up a combo-multiplier. How many points the player gets depends on how high the multiplier is, where he hit the enemy and if he performed a special action before the kill like breaking through a door or jumping through a window. Each kill increases the multiplier by one but if the player waits too long between kills, it decreases. The higher it was at the last kill, the faster it will decrease. The game also features 8 different multiplayer-modes. These include normal Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch as well as modes like Team Fox Hunt in which the teams need to kill the fox of the enemy team in order to win."

To deal with them, both Lang and Graves have access to several types of weapons from pistols over snipers to machine guns, rocket launchers and several different kinds of grenades. But they also earn upgrades for these weapons after successfully finishing a mission. The first upgrade to Graves's 7.62m Sniper Rifle for example allows the player to fire a bullet around the corner or over low cover."

Ten years later, Kazuma returns to his home town Kamurocho. He finds out that Yumi Sawamura, a young woman he grew up with in the orphanage, has disappeared.

Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch. The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics."

But beware! Make the wrong choice, and you could end up dead. Delving into themes of free will and the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make, this game is an experience unlike anything else.  Vincent’s heart is torn between two women. On one side sits Katherine, the girl who intends to wed Vincent someday. On the other, Catherine, who appeared out of nowhere. Both of them pull at his heart and soul... The story can take many paths, and the outcome of this romantic horror tale can go to unimaginable places.  Move the blocks to create a path and climb a nightmarish tower while fleeing from the monsters chasing you. The lowest levels of blocks fall as time passes. If you’re not constantly moving, you’ll fall with them. The setting changes each night, rising higher and higher into the heavens. The more stages Vincent overcomes, the more complex the strategies required to progress will become.  Various obstacles impede Vincent’s path. Some blocks are traps, waiting to skewer unwary climbers. Others explode, damaging everything around them. The sheep in the nightmare are desperate to survive until morning, too. They’ll get in your way, mess up your blocks, or even try to shove you off. You’ll need your wits and the help of strange items that can deal with the sheep, remove hazards or create new paths if you want to reach the top!"

Instead of following the journey of Zoey, Francis, Louis and Bill from the first game, the player gets to control Coach, Rochelle, Nick or Ellis. They arrived a few minutes too late at the evacuation point and now need to fight their way through the south-eastern part of infected America to the next official evacuation point. The core gameplay has not changed since Left 4 Dead. The player still looks through the eyes of one of the survivors and fights his way together with his three team mates through hordes and hordes of zombies. Instead of fighting mainly in the dark, most content of the five campaigns takes place both out in the open and in daylight. This also plays into the hands of a new feature: weather effects. The second part of the third campaign is even completely build around the theme of a heavy storm hitting a small town on the outskirts. Heavy rain is not the only new enemy for the survivors. The zombie horde also grew through the addition of three new special infected called Charger (a smaller version of the tank), Jockey (he jumps onto a team mate and moves him away from the group), Spitter (spits deadly acid in front of the player's feet) and a new class of common infected: the uncommon common infected. They have the same basic attributes as normal zombies but have a special ability. The clown for example attracts a horde of zombies, while the riot police man is immune to damage from the front. To take on new and old enemies the weaponry has been greatly expanded. Besides new rifles, pistols and shotguns, melee weapons such a a chainsaw, a guitar and a baseball bat have been introduced to the game. Also new is a laser sight that can be used to increase the accuracy of a weapon as well as two types of special ammunition. In addition the Boomer Bile is now available to launch at enemies and turn the raging horde against them. Multiplayer once again consists of several different modes. Beside playing through the campaigns cooperatively and playing both the survivors and special infected in the Versus mode, the players can choose the Survival, Scavenge and Realism Mode. Survival pits the players against wave after wave of enemies with the only goal being to survive as long as possible. Scavenge requires the players to collect fuel canisters to fill up a generator while the other team, playing as special infected, tries to stop them. Realism Mode is a variation of coop-play for hardcore zombieslayers. The stakes are much higher there. The zombies can only be killed with a headshot, the witch has changed into a one-hit-one-kill-weapon, and a downed player is dead unless he is revived with the shock paddles. The last mode is Mutation, which has the player play a game with different rules. The rules are changed every week. The player might have to do the entire game using only M60's or play Survival combined with Versus."

Not only does this setting provide a rich backdrop to the action but it fosters a unique and thrilling triple-threat battle scenario for the game modes. Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players compete against their team's opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element that could only exist in the twisted Resident Evil universe. The result is a brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With a cover-up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo."

His quest is to find a cure and to do so he affiliates with crusaders where he gets to know Esteban Noviembre who has the same curse to bear. During the course of the game they will have to fight against an also cursed group with sinister plans. Noviembre is either controlled by the AI or another player. The basic premise of this game is a traditional hack & slay: walking through linear levels and killing a lot of enemies with a focus on melee combat. But the curse gives de Bayle the ability to switch between the normal game world and a hell version. This has a few advantages: the heroes get stronger, have special attacks and can find collectibles. However, being in the hell world drains energy which is refilled by killing enemies. For every weapon there is a skill tree with combo attacks. Those are unlocked with victory points which are earned by solving the mission and finding the mentioned collectibles in hell or hidden treasure chests."

Alice was the only survivor of the terrible accident. After repeated attempts at suicide, she gets locked up inside a mental institution and is slowly wasting away there before she is summoned to Wonderland again by the White Rabbit. But this time it's a Wonderland gone seriously bad and gory. The only chance for Alice to restore her peace of mind and find out more about the death of her parents is to fight through Wonderland and free it from the evil powers. American McGee's Alice is a direct sequel to Lewis Carroll's book Through the Looking-Glass, itself a sequel to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The player controls Alice as she tries to find her way and eventually escape from the demented surroundings of her own fantasy world that she's been thrust into. The surreal environments utilize themes from Lewis Carroll's original books, applying a noticeably darker and more violent edge to them. The gameplay is third-person action with platforming, shooting, and light puzzle-solving elements. Alice starts with a knife, which can be used as a melee weapon or thrown at enemies. Later she acquires other weapons, such as a staff that shoots bolts of energy, dice that emit deadly gas, a time-stopping watch, and others. Weapons have an alternate fire mode, which usually inflicts more damage but depletes Alice's magical energy. The latter, along with Alice's health, can be restored by collecting the essence of defeated foes. The game also features platforming sequences, during which Alice has to jump over gaps, avoid obstacles, or climb in order to reach her goal. Puzzle-solving usually involves manipulating the environment rather than using inventory items. The game was re-released as part of select editions of the 2011 sequel, Alice: Madness Returns, as a downloadable extra. The content is identical, but with widescreen support, updated controller support, compatibility tweaks and higher-resolution textures."

Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park. Edward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram. This is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out. Fire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way."

When they killed Herbert Friedman, the conductor of the biological experiment with the black flowers, they assumed everything was okay, of course it was not. The seeds of the flower had already spread around and it grew and blossomed without much notice. When it was discovered, that the flowers contain a dangerous substance that induces strange but vivid dreams, it became the new hit drug on the campus. Now the seeds begin to germinate and the bad trip turns into a horrible nightmare. The only ones that really know what is going on are the ones that are experiencing it for the second time and hide terrible secrets inside themselves... Most of the time you take control over two of the six available characters. Each one has a speciality that comes in handy in order to open blocked doors or reaching new heights. Kenny for example has more muscles than brain and is therefore able to move around crates. Mei is instead a hacker and knows how to hack access panels. You can switch between both characters at any time and if you need another character in a given situation, you can go back to a gathering point and change your team."

One group of brave teens decides to find out what's going on... no matter what. They have no idea what kind of horrors have gripped the school and everyone in it. In the darkness, the evil has power... but add light and they can be defeated. Will they survive the night ahead? In Solo Mode, choose from 5 characters with different personalities, aptitude and perspectives. Change between them at any time (as long as they are still alive). The player can also select a second person (as a \"teammate\") to accompany the player by going to a \"gathering point\" in the game. At any time during play, the player can switch control between the first character and the second, thereby accessing their special talents. There are several basic types of weapons used in the game: contact (a baseball bat for instance), pistols, guns, and more exotic, high-powered \"special\" weapons. Ammunition is specific for each gun or pistol and is not interchangeable. Weapons can be swapped between characters and ammunition found is stored in the group's reserves for sharing amongst them. The player will also be gathering up first-aid kits, discs (for saving games), keys, screwdrivers and other tools. Other objects are required for solving riddles within the game."

He is part of an investigation looking for a serial killer known as The Match Maker, who kills people and then arranges their corpse with a department store mannequin. During the search Thomas comes across another serial killer who seems to be very interested in Thomas and his cases. It is up to you to determine who the true serial killer is, and who is behind it. The game is played from a first-person perspective with a variety of weapons to attack your enemies. Focusing on melee combat Thomas can grab items directly from the environment, such as signs, pipes, 2x4's, concrete, rails, planks of wood, even desktops and desk drawers. There is also a supply of firearms, such as the standard pistol and shotgun, but all of those only have a limited amount of ammo. The hunt takes Thomas across several different areas, from an abandoned office building to a subway station to an elementary school to an apple farm on the outskirts of town, battling all kinds of deranged people along the way. Combat is brutal and Thomas is able to perform a number of graphic finishing moves. The game is largely set in dark and narrow environment, with many horror elements. Lighting is scarce and Thomas has to use his flashlight at all time to light the environment. Enemies are also able to pull fuses to turn off lights and use the new darkness to their advantage. Movement is generally slow, but Thomas is able to sprint for a short moment. Health is replenished through kits scattered around. Enemies engage using the same weapons and they are also able to grab Thomas, which requires moving around frantically until they let go, with a dark haze over the screen visualizing the effects of strangulation. The screen also often turns grainy when Thomas has strange visions related to the serial killers. Next to the combat there are also many moments where Thomas has to investigate the scenes, using several different types of forensic tools to find clues and help further the story. Use the UV light to find traces of blood, get a blood sample using the sample guy, use your laser light to find evidence that may be hidden. You also have a scanner to scan certain items, and a digital camera for any photographs which need to be taken. Most of the importation is processed at the bureau and Thomas keeps in touch with them through his phone."

It seems that a bunch of tabloid leather-fetish cyborg aliens have abducted the town's stereotypical redneck inhabitants and cloned them. The aliens have also abducted Bessie, the prize pig of brothers Leonard and Bubba. As Leonard you'll have to fight the local yokel clones as well as the aliens throughout Hickston to rescue your pig.  The 'Redneck' theme is used very heavily. Levels range from trailer parks to chicken processing plants, and the arsenal of odd weapons include a gun that shoots circular saws, a TNT crossbow, and even a machine gun bra. Also, instead of armor and health kits, you restore health and become tougher by drinking whisky and eating pork rinds.

The third game in the TimeSplitters series, Future Perfect is a first-person shooter in the same vein as its predecessors. The main campaign can be played through in single-player mode or cooperatively by two players, and multiplayer modes can be played by up to four players in split-screen mode or with up to eight players via LAN or the internet. The story campaign consists of thirteen missions spanning six different time periods, and in each period Cortez meets and teams up with a contemporary character. The single-player mode sees these companions controlled by the AI, while co-op mode assigns them to player two. Each time period features its own arsenal meaning that players typically use era-appropriate weaponry throughout the campaign, and several missions include vehicle or turret sequences. In addition to the main campaign, there are several other game modes available. There's Arcade, available both as a single-player \"League\" against NPC opponents and as a multiplayer mode (which can also be played with NPC opponents if desired). Arcade mode allows players to choose from the 150 playable characters, and includes genre standbys like Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag (or \"Capture the Bag\" in this instance), as well as more distinctive offerings such as Escort, Shrink, and Monkey Assistant. Beyond that there's also a Challenge mode, in which the missions are more focused in scope - for instance, the \"Behead the Undead\" set of challenges is all about dismembering zombies.

For killing needs, the player has a plethora of ways to dispatch people: kick them, urinate on them (making them vomit), shoot them, bash them with a shovel, throw gas on them and set them ablaze, leaving behind a charred corpse, and if the player wants to be stealthy, it is possible to pick up a cat and stick a shotgun into its rear end to use it as a silencer.

A rampage mode is charged up while fighting and there are also bonus items such as shields or rocket launchers. The game incorporates Action Trigger Events (A.T.E.) where actions in the environments can be triggered to influence the combat. Examples of these are plane crashes, black holes or a blitz bombing. The game's backstory describes Earth as a mutant-infested wasteland with monsters and cyborgs following a new world war. The focus is largely on multiplayer with game modes that include Battle Royale, Capture the Flag, Death Ball, Death Match, Survival and Tag Team, for up to sixteen players simultaneously. There is also a single-player campaign that largely shares the assets of the multiplayer environments. It is split up into two parts, one for Jack Cayman, the Gator Tooth double chainsaw-wielding protagonist from MadWorld and one for Leonhardt \"Leo\" Victorion,—a new character—an agent of the Bureau's Strike One unit who wields positron blades that can be charged. In the single-player portion, there are many hub areas where a certain amount of enemies needs to be defeated in order to progress and enter new missions. At certain points the campaigns cross over. Jack and Leo are enemies and they both want to hunt down Maximillian Caxton responsible for killing Jack's daughter. After the four stages of each campaign (White and Black), Red is opened up as an additional one.

The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release in November 2012. The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1754 to 1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control in the colonies. Assassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team-based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers.

        "daljsi_opis": "BoneCraft: Somewhere in Some Galaxy is the second game created by D-Dub Software. It is a follow-up to 2008’s Action Adventure Porno Video Game, BoneTown. A parody of everything science fiction and fantasy, BoneCraft brings together many popular stories into one hilarious sexy romp. “BoneCraft is a world where anything can happen–and does,” says Hod, D-Dub’s Lead Developer. BoneCraft is a third-person action-adventure game with a unique sex dynamic merged seamlessly into the gameplay. The game follows the exploits of Captain Fort Worth, the leader of the Space Wranglers, and his sidekick, Lubbock. \r\nPlot The story begins with Captain Fort Worth (Neil Kaplan) and Lubbock (Anson Rotola) cruising through space in their ship the USS Longstreet. After drinking too much Jet Fuel, Lubbock brings up a subject he knows sends Fort into a rage: Elven women. Earlier in Fort’s galactial campaigns he had the chance to bone the crown jewel of the galaxy, the Elf Queen, but was foiled by the Elven Army. Since then, Fort has lived with the pain of the only one he ever let get away. Fort flies into a rage and crash-lands the ship on a nearby planet inhabited by an Orc tribe. When the Wranglers try to enforce their interstellar extinction policy on the Orc, Fort discovers that the Orc tribe is not only led by an old friend of his, Warboss Swampass (Gabriel Brooks), but that the planet is also harboring an Elven Brothel…and the Elf Queen herself. Fort and his Wranglers must fight their way through Orc and Elf men, bone their way through the women, and take on everything from the metrosexual ranks of the Elven Army to the galaxy’s most dreaded creatures, the fearsome Dick Monsters, to make sure Fort finally gets the Holy Grail."

        "daljsi_opis": "With a goal of fusing tension and drama found in movies with the game mechanics of the role-playing genre, the original Parasite Eve was Square's first attempt at creating a cinematic RPG; it was a commercial success, selling loads of copies to role-playing and survival horror fanatics. Because of the acclaim, the powerhouse development company did the only thing possible -- a sequel. Before detailing the follow-up, here's some background: the plot of the original game dealt with Eve, a woman transformed into a killing machine by a life form known as mitochondria. The infected woman/monster went on a bloody rampage through New York City, destroying anything and everyone in her path. Assuming the role of a young police officer named Aya Brea, it was in the players' hands to solve the murder case and thwart the vile creature; the awaking of her mitochondria gave her the clues and prowess to stop the madness of Eve. A few years have passed since the occurrences in New York. Aya Brea has joined the Federal Bureau of Investigations' Mitochondria Investigation and Suppression Team (M.I.S.T for short). After a series of strange incidents, the heroine is called into action and ordered to investigate the unfolding mystery once again. Human beings have begun transforming into hideous monsters known as Neo Mitochondrion Creatures; it is suspected that Eve is behind these bizarre events. While the look and feel of Parasite Eve II resembles the original, it features revamped character models with facial expressions and motion-captured animation, pre-rendered backgrounds, an overhauled battle system and full-motion video clips for storyline progression; the in-game dialogue is presented in written form with text boxes. Spanning dust-ridden ghost towns, elaborate laboratories and ancient dwellings, monsters roam about resulting in survival horror elements and scares galore! Whereas the original featured pseudo turn-based battles, the sequel's action sequences unfurl in real-time; you can dodge enemy attacks, run away or strategically decimate the opposition. Taking pieces from the sci-fi world, Aya Brea has been endowed with psychic powers and psionic spells including meditation, healing and offensive fire blasts in addition to conventional pistols and machine guns. Once the battle has finished, the heroine will receive two point awards: XP and BP. While XP points lean towards learning new spells (12 in all), BP points will have you customizing and buying weapons and items; enhancing weapons means purchasing or finding the right parts. Items include healing and effect-ridding canisters, different types of ammunition and important objects vital to the quest. Along the way, Aya will come in contact with other characters including a bounty hunter named Kyle Madigan, a weapons expert named Gary Douglas and M.I.S.T agents Pierce Carradine and Rupert Broderick, all of which offer help and advice. Additionally, the various locations are laced with puzzles ranging from finding certain key cards to solving riddles and manipulating gears and pictures for the sake of progress. A single-player experience, Parasite Eve II offers three different endings (depending on how well you do) and supports PlayStation memory cards for saving game data and the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog controls and the vibration function."

        "daljsi_opis": "This is a survival horror game based on the Saw movie franchise. Players assume the role of a kidnapped detective who must find a way to escape a decrepit, abandoned asylum. The object of the game is to survive the lethal traps and puzzles that 'Jigsaw,' a serial killer, has placed for the detective-player and others. As players explore the dilapidated rooms and corridors, they will encounter a number of puzzle-based traps that will kill the player or other victims if they are not completed correctly or in the allotted amount of time. Some captives are rigged with bear traps/explosives around their heads or, more often, strapped down into elaborate mechanical death traps. The depictions of death from these devices can be intense: One character is killed by spinning saw blades; an iron maiden contraption snaps shut on another character, resulting in a fountain of blood; one victim screams loudly as he is burned alive inside an incinerator; a torture rack springs to life with a strong implication that a body has been ripped in half. Although players must save victims to progress through the game, some captives, engaged in their own 'game' of survival, can become hostile and attack the player. Players can defend themselves by using spiked bats, pipes, and mannequin arms found throughout the assylum. Players are able to place bombs on the ground as weapons against enemies or lure hostiles through tripwire shotgun traps; these bombs/traps usually decapitate enemies, causing a gush of blood and chunks of flesh to litter the environment. During the course of the game, some victims' back stories will include references to drug use/abuse (e.g., 'I promise I won't do it anymore. The drugs, the cutting, none of it'; LSD is also referenced within a patient's files). Strong profanity (e.g., 'f*ck') can be heard in the dialogue."

Rather than celebrating the dawn of a new millennium, the Union City residents are suffering from malicious gang wars, terrorists and widespread famine. The once friendly streets are an open battleground for anyone wanting to solve their problems. Many fear the Apocalypse is at hand; ancient predictions cast by Nostradamus are becoming a reality. The Union City police force has a difficult mission at hand: they're to restore order to the once peaceful city by any means necessary. Players assume the role of either D'arci Stern or Roper McIntyre. Whereas the hardened and mentally unstable Roper uses his knowledge of advanced weaponry and highly explosive materials to get the job done, D'arci is an excellent sleuth specializing in stealthy infiltration and reconnaissance missions. Spanning thirty missions, Urban Chaos takes the player on a wild third-person adventure filled with explosive action and terrorist activities. Depending on the character, missions include highly dangerous infiltration objectives, arresting terrorist masterminds, and the eradication of street gangs. By successfully completing each mission, an apocalyptic story is slowly unraveled; something is definitely wrong in the city and it's not just crime. Union City is broken down into a series of neighborhoods crawling with terrorist activity and scared pedestrians. Using a non-linear gameplay method of exploration and interactivity, players will question civilians for any information they may have about the whereabouts of wanted criminals. They'll often guide you to the completion of your quest, so pay close attention! Players will also engage in a series of frantic car chases throughout congested city streets; utilizing armored squad and civilian vehicles, players should be on the lookout for ambushes and car bombs! On certain infiltration and seek and destroy missions, combat ensues from the fleeing terrorists. Using a variety of hand-to-hand combination attacks (kicks, slides, and punches), pistols, and assault rifles, players will assault tough-willed street gangs and put an end to their waves of crime. While killing the bad guys is certainly an option, try arresting them for questioning and clues regarding criminal activities. Urban Chaos a realized 3D engine with weather, time, and pollution effects for added realism. Game progress can be saved with a PlayStation memory card and makes full use of the Dual Shock Analog Controller for unprecedented control and feel. The city needs a hero -- can you save the innocent civilians from the arms of Armageddon?"

It takes place parallel to the first game where War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, went to Earth after he was stripped of his powers and in tricked in causing a war between heaven and hell. His brother Death is convinced of his innocence and sets out at the same time to resurrect humanity and prove his brother's innocence. He travels through different lands and locations to restore the mistakes and kill those responsible. The gameplay with its third-person hack-and-slash is similar to the first game. The environments consists of large open world areas where dungeons lead to new locations. Death can travel the distances on foot or using his horse Despair. Another character is the raven Dust that helps locate objectives. Both can accessed by the player through a key or button. Fast travel is available as well and it is possible to return to the overworld from inside a dungeon, saving progress there, to continue later. Next to the action there are also still many environment-based puzzles that require the manipulation of levers, tiles, pressure plates, doors and portals to progress. A lot of time is also spent on exploring and navigating the environment, including climbing using fixed points, running along walls and swimming. Compared to War in the first game, Death is much more agile and can perform acrobatic moves. Similar to the first game many more mechanics are unlocked along the way, such as the Death Grip grappling hook and the Voidwalker portal gun. Other abilities are Soul Splitter and Interdiction to control other characters, often to solve puzzles. Many levels also have large boss characters with QTE-finishing moves. Death's primary weapons are dual-wielded scythes (often traded in for better ones after time), along with various secondary melee weapons that provide a range of powerful but slow, or fast but lighter attacks. Attacks are based around striking, dodging and blocking combined with a lock-on mechanic. Later abilities also offer ranged attacks or the option to summon ghouls that fight along and can be made to explode when their health is running low. The three main resources are health, wrath and reaper, along with an overall experience meter. Wrath is used to activate special abilities and reaper allows Death to transform into his grim reaper form with much more powerful attacks. Just like the first game there is a light role-playing element as experience contributes to eight statistics along with an overall class level. When leveling up, a skill point can be spent in two skill trees to open up new abilities. Resources and the currency are gained by defeating enemies, looting chests or from vendors, and new items are also found that way. Next to the customization page for the primary and the secondary weapon, there are separate tabs for armor, boot glove, shoulder and talisman. New moves also need to be bought. Death also discovers possessed weapons that can be upgraded by sacrificing lesser weapons. Another resource is discovered through bluestones, hidden in the world. There are three types and they can be combined to be sold in groups of three to a character called Blackroot for permanent upgrades and abilities."

The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot. The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film."

        "daljsi_opis": "Aliens vs Predator is an update of the 1999 PC game Aliens Versus Predator, in which the player can choose either Marine, Xenomorph (commonly known as Aliens) or Predator in a first-person shooter. The story takes place on the planet designated BG-386, in a mining colony owned by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation where they have found a mysterious site; an ancient pyramid that depicts an unknown alien race and the Xenomorphs. Curious, they decide to forcibly open the doors and cause a massive energy backlash that causes the power on the entire planet to go out, unleashing hell in the process. This is where the story begins for the three factions: Marine: The player takes control of the \"Rookie\" as they are dispatched to the planet to investigate the distress signal. Once arriving they realize that a Alien outbreak has occurred and the player must traverse various environments. There are various weapons such as a pistol, pulse rifle, sniper rifle, flamethrower, shotgun and the smart gun the player can use against the various enemies scattered throughout the stages. There is also the iconic motion tracker that can pick up on enemy movement, flares and a flashlight for seeing in very dark spaces and stims that will replenish their health. Aliens: The player takes control of an Alien nicknamed \"Six\". Captured and raised by Weyland-Yutani scientists, Six has been hearing the call of the Matriarch for a period of time, desperate to escape and join his brethren. When the power in the colony goes out, Six escapes and begins to wreak havoc against the humans and propagate his species across the planet. The Aliens are considered very weak and vulnerable and only have their claws and tails as weapons, but possess great speed and the ability to climb on walls and ceilings. Health can automatically regenerate, but the player can bite the head of a fallen enemy to automatically regenerate their health. Predators: The player takes control of a Youngblood; fresh from training he receives word from the Predator council that a distress signal from a long lost hunting ground has been set off. He is then dispatched to the planet to investigate, upon arriving he discovers humans have taken over the planet and unleashed the serpents (The term the Predators use for the Aliens) upon the planet. The council orders him to wipe out the human and alien presence and discover the secret of the hunting grounds. Weapons include the Plasma Caster, Wrist blades, Combi-Stick, Mines and the Smart Disc with health being replenished through shards. The Predator can also leap across long distances, mimic voices to distract victims away from groups and use their signature cloaking device to move through enemy encampments without being detected."

This game takes the player through several sections of the facility, including a warehouse and underground tunnels. The player is tasked, along with fellow STAAR members, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must kill all of the genetically altered soldiers and aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members (at the cost of one life point), however if nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter will be started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels. None of the actual aliens will appear until the office level.\r\n \r\nThere are five types of different weaponry available to the player during the course of the game. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets throughout the game. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy in able to kill it. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol. The player will also find grenades in crates and bonus rooms which, when used, destroys most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a max of 9 grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with \"flammable\" warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies."

However, Samanosuke changes places with a French officer from the future named Jacques Blanc, and both have to adapt to their new worlds to get rid of Genma army and stop Oda Nobunaga's ambitions to conquer the world.

The development from this game started after the release of the PlayStation 2 which allowed the team to work on a 3D engine to design 3D backgrounds.

A great deal of the game revolves around the personalities of the fighters and the usage of the reputation system. Several matches will require that the player be sworn not to use dirty tactics such as using weapons found around the ring or even to humiliate the opponent. These oaths can be broken by the player, but the consequences are the loss of fan popularity and for the player's chosen character to develop a dark side to their persona."

As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are. The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target. It can be played with a friend in local 2-player co-op. Players can revive each other."

Enemies include everything the alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission. Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving."

Darksiders II follows the exploits of Deat, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.  Like the original Darksiders game before it, the second game in the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including \"The White city,\" an outpost where angels live, and \"The Eternal Throne,\" a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to a terrifying and powerful pale mount."

        "daljsi_opis": "Black Ops II is the ninth main title in the Call of Duty first-person shooter franchise and the sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops. It is set primarily in the near future of 2025 with one third of the game also taking place in the late 1980s. The timelines and story are connected through the playable characters of Alex Mason and Frank Woods in the past, and David Mason — the son of Alex Mason — in the future timeline. The future missions also feature an aged Woods giving exposition for the 1980s backdrop and share the same villain, Raul Menendez, who's decades long vendetta is the primary focus of the single player campaign. The plot centers on a new cold war between China and The United States over REE (Rare Earth Elements) and its manipulation by Menendez. It has an emphasis on unmanned drones and other robotic technology — a first for the series. Another first for the series is the ability to customize multiplayer-style loadouts before each mission as well as a far less linear campaign. The player can now make choices throughout the storyline that can affect small aspects such as the appearance of NPCs all the way to major decisions that can change the ending entirely. There are new sandbox-style missions dubbed Strike Force. Playing similar to a real-time strategy game, these missions give the player the opportunity to command troops and drones from an overhead view but with the option to zoom into any one of the units, at which point the gameplay switches to standard first-person shooter controls and gameplay. Strike Force is implemented within the campaign and has repercussions on the storyline depending on how the player performs. Multiplayer comes with familiar game modes (Deathmatch, Domination, Kill Confirmed, etc.) and ranking. The loadout system has however been changed to a new ten-point system that is unlike any prior title in the series. Players are given 10 points to use on weapons, attachments, and perks, each costing 1 point. The game also introduces wildcards, players can choose up to 3, which allows players to break the rules of create-a-class by either, having three attachments on their primary weapon, two perks of the first tier, or more lethal grenades, but more points are used. The playercard, stats tracking and emblem creation from Black Ops return as well as theater mode and combat training (which is now integrated into multiplayer as a playlist). Dedicated servers return to the PC version albeit with restrictions. Players cannot host servers themselves; rather Activision hosts them and they must still be joined through the now standard matchmaking system. Killstreaks have been renamed scorestreaks as points now factor in as well as kills — encouraging less camping and more playing of the objective. New scorestreaks include lightning strikes (similar to napalm strikes and mortar strikes of the past), unmanned dragonfire drones which hunt down and kill enemy players, among others. Returning strikes include dogs, RC-XD exploding cars, and franchise standards such as the UAV and care packages. The Call of Duty: Elite service is now free and new league matches have been introduced. Similar to games like StarCraft II, league matches put a player into a division (Bronze, Silver, etc) after which they play on a competitive ladder with other players of similar skill. League games have comprehensive stat tracking and leaderboards available to all players through the Elite service."

Players are cast in the role of a troubled inmate named Torque, who has been condemned to death for a crime he may or may not have committed. When the spirits of the prison inadvertently free him from captivity, Torque begins a grueling quest for survival as he uncovers the clues to make sense of his bewildering past. To battle his grotesque foes, Torque can find and use ten different weapons, ranging from revolvers to Tommy guns. The protagonist also hides a dark secret that allows him to transform into a superhuman creature when pushed too far, at which point he can unleash his pent-up rage for a limited time. Levels are set within prison walls as well as outdoor surroundings, as enemies attack from jail cells, torture chambers, underneath the ground, from behind trees, and more.

Borderlands 2, like its predecessor, is a first-person shooter that incorporates character building, quests and procedural content generation elements from role-playing games, particularly roguelikes, along with vehicle-based gameplay from contemporary shooters. The sequel features four new characters embodying four classes that represent different special skills and weapon affinities. Accumulated experience points result in skill points, which can then be allocated to the nodes of one of three skill trees that vary between classes. Weapons differ not only by type, firing speed or damage, they can also cause elemental damage that is more or less effective against specific types of opponents. Players can take on the game's challenges by themselves, or enlist the help of other players in the cooperative multiplayer mode. Compared to the first game, the game world is not split into disjunct pieces anymore, but has become continuously connected. Non-player characters now follow their own schedules and agendas as opposed to being fixed in their position permanently."

Jensen finds himself captured on a Belltower ship, ready to be tortured. Fortunately a mysterious hacker frees him and now Jensen needs to uncover the conspiracies of his surroundings."

        "daljsi_opis": "The Scourge Project is a third-person shooter set in the near future, where players assume the role of the Echo Squad, a group of specialized mercenaries under the orders of Tarn, a dissident faction that is trying to unmask the strange experiments and businesses of the Nogari Corporation, a company that has exclusive control on the production of Ambrosia, a new form of energy that has replaced the already exhausted traditional power sources. The mission in the game is to rescue Dr. Reisbeck, a double agent that has been able to infiltrate the company's facilities in the Island of Nogari and retrieve a sample of a meteorite that the corporation keeps heavily guarded, which is suspected to be the original source of Ambrosia. During the course of the game players can choose to control any of the four characters that are part of the Echo Squad: Stonewall, Shade, Amp and Mass. They all have a different point of view of how the story develops, each having a unique set of flashbacks that will determine their intentions and objectives. Each one of them has also a combination of special abilities that are different from their teammate's, which will change the game experience depending on the chosen character. In the campaign menu there are three game modes:     Single player: control a specific character and the rest of the team will be managed by the computer's AI.\r\n    Co-op: in this mode players can go online, each one of them playing the role of one of the four different team members.\r\n    Action mode: the player controls one character only, without the rest of the team. In this mode there are no flashbacks or any story elements of the adventure, just pure action in the different settings of the game. In the multiplayer mode there are several additional maps, where it is possible to play Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture-the-Flag and Frontiers' games with up to sixteen players. The game has an order system (QOS Quick-Order-System) through which players can give basic instructions to the teammates, whether they are real players or AI controlled players. There is also an experience and medal system that gets updated as players advance through the Campaign and Multiplayer modes."

His father was involved in an illegal, top-secret experiment for a company called WynTech Industries. Nearly nothing is known about the true nature of this experiment; but something in it affected the sanity of Curtis' mother, eventually driving her to suicide. Curtis' father was later shot, leaving the poor little boy with serious behavioural disturbances, and eventually in therapy. Now, a year after having been released from the mental institution, Curtis is employed at WynTech Industries, whose manager, Paul Warner, has seemingly taken it upon himself to take care of Curtis. He tries to find the cause of his psychotic episodes and the mysterious murders that break out all around him, all the while discovering more and more about his past life and his father's fate. Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh is not an actual sequel to the original Phantasmagoria, but rather a follow-up that has similar themes and visual concept. The game is more heavy on puzzles and traditional adventure gameplay than its predecessor. The gameplay involves standard activities found in adventure games, including extended conversations with the characters featuring selectable dialogue topics, collecting and manipulating inventory items with the environment, etc. It is possible (and often necessary) to call characters on the phone, as well as check and answer e-mails accessed by Curtis' computer at his workplace. Like its predecessor, the game has a simple point-and-click interface and employs video sequences with live actors as cutscenes. Short movies are usually shown after each action performed by the protagonist."

The colonization of the red planet is vital for humanity's survival, as the heavily polluted Earth's resources are nearly depleted. At the same time, the Taar, a mysterious alien race that lost their homeworld many centuries ago, has decided to take Mars as their new home. As the war between the two species erupts, the player has to choose his side and lead his people to ultimate domination over the red planet. Things become even more complicated when the ruins of an extinct ancient civilization are found on Mars, revealing immensely destructive weapons that could easily turn the tide of the war in favor of the faction that manages to gain control over them first. Dark Colony is a real-time strategy with heavy emphasis on the actual combat. Resource gathering, base construction and unit production have been made as simple and fast as possible, allowing the player to focus on decimating the enemy armies. Ancient artifacts, available in some of the missions, provide unique options for beating the odds, even when they seem to be against you (and they often will). The game plot advances through short cutscenes, briefings and debriefings which detail the development of the war. The game also offers various promotions and decorations that you can earn for your player character, who will actually be present on the battlefield, acting as a more powerful and durable trooper with some special abilities (such as calling in reinforcements and inspiring the regular troopers)."

Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform \"stealth kills\" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar."

        "daljsi_opis": "With the threat of civil war at an all-time high and bloodthirsty warlords in pursuit of territory and regional recognition, Japan desperately needs an intervention -- a group of heroes that will band together and save the once peaceful land. When desperation sets in, the common man looks to the House of Gohda; Lord Gohda Matsunoshin enlists the services of deadly, shadow warriors known as the Azuma Ninja in times of dire need. Matsunoshin has called upon three young warriors: Rikimaru, Ayame and Tatsumaru; the aforementioned characters, excluding the latter, were called upon in Tenchu: Stealth Assassins. Whereas Rikimaru is a tranquil, ardent ninja, the dagger wielding Ayame has a rebellious attitude -- she's also the youngest of the three. With exceptional sword abilities and having been trained as a future leader of the Azuma Ninja, Tatsumaru is the most prominent of the three. Together, they'll not only have to save the House of Gohda from an unparalleled evil, the young ninjas must improve their stealth and further develop their skills. Developed by Acquire, Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins is a prequel to Tenchu: Stealth Assassins; the events found within this game happened before those in the original. Retaining the third-person 3D viewpoint and stealth tactics, this prequel features over 21 new techniques including devastating deathblows and weapon combinations. Depending on which character you choose will determine your fighting style as each comes with his or her own unique weapons. Unlike the original, characters can now swim through trenches and other bodies of water. Additionally, players now have the option of dragging dead corpses into secluded areas; if someone sees a dead body, they're going to know something's wrong and begin combing the area for clues. There are 29 unique missions involving the assassination of certain warlords, the protection of innocents and the elimination of unwanted troops. While you could run out in the open, the point behind this series is to remain undetected and silently slay the given targets. This involves propelling yourself onto rooftops and trees with a grappling hook and quietly sliding around walls while focusing on the surrounding environment. Finishing missions without being seen will earn you higher rankings and secret goodies; if your only concern is to finish the game, feel free to rush through each level. Rankings are as follows: stealth kills are 20 points and normal kills are five points with 150 and 30 point deductions coming in the form of murdering an innocent and being spotted; if you remain unseen throughout an entire level, you're awarded 300 points. In addition to your characters' default weapons, you'll have access to a wide variety of Azuma Ninja weapons and items including flaming arrows, mines, colored rice used for navigational purposes, poison rice, throwing stars and healing potions. Once you've been detected by an enemy, use the leaves of stealth to disorient him; after the effect wears off, your character will be positioned behind the enemy, waiting to cut his throat or snap his neck. Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins also includes a Mission Editor that allows to create your very own mission objectives and 3D worlds. After giving the mission a name and objective, you can utilize the terrain or character editor and begin constructing a level; building either a dojo or village-type level, you'll have access to textures and prefabricated items found within the actual game. Although the developers denied players full use of the game's engine editor (there are no backgrounds in custom made scenarios), it allows you to adjust terrain heights, place trees and assorted items and set patrolling paths for the enemy forces you put into the map."

Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die.

New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure.

        "daljsi_opis": "Long ago, before humans existed, the world was ruled by dragons. However, when humans came along, the dragons were all but wiped out thanks to the Four Lords, mighty god-like beings who defeated them in an epic battle. The Age of Fire began, a golden age for humanity, but such prosperity could not last. A curious affliction has started to appear: called the Darksign, those it brands are cursed to become an immortal undead, forever returning from death until they ultimately lose their minds. It is said that one day, a Chosen Undead will appear, and a great change will occur in the world. One of the many undead manages to escape the asylum he was locked in, which is seen as the first sign for the role he will eventually play. Dark Souls is a third-person action RPG and a spiritual successor to 2009's Demon's Souls. Mechanically, it is very similar to its predecessor. The player can choose between several character classes for the protagonist, choose the gender, and customize his or her physical appearance. Character attributes can be manually increased when leveling up. The game takes place in a series of interconnected, mostly dungeon-like areas populated by enemies. Some areas can be accessed freely, though the enemies there may be too hard for the player to tackle at earlier stages. Combat allows detailed options such as active parrying, blocking, rolling, and different attacks with equipped weapon. The player must pay close attention to both their vitality and stamina meters. All actions will reduce stamina, and when the stamina bar is empty the player is left vulnerable. Much like its predecessor, Dark Souls touts its hardcore pedigree and high level of difficulty. Even the most mundane of enemies can be deadly if not handled with care, and many situations will seem impossibly unfair at first glance, but there is always a solution to be found. The game takes place in the kingdom of Lordran, which is a large continuous world where all areas of the game are interconnected. The game also features a unique and extensive online play system, where players can attack or assist each other for benefits, as well as find and leave messages for each other. The player can improve their abilities and equipment using Souls, which are taken from defeated enemies and function both as a currency and experience points. There is also a secondary, much more scarce currency called Humanity, which provides a number of situational benefits. Humanity can be used to revive to human form, which allows the player to kindle bonfires to earn more healing items, as well as to call for assistance from NPCs or other players. However, if the player is defeated, they will revert to hollow, return to the last bonfire they rested at, and lose all souls and humanity they had on them. It can be recovered by reaching the spot where they died, but if they die again before collecting them, they are lost forever."

You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills."

The world Above reflects a chrome city, a high-rise, high-tech metropolis served by elevators and elevated freeways. A place for hardworkers and law-abiding people. On the contrary to Above, the world Below, which is the product of earthquake damages, is a subterranean network of labour colonies. Those who are not wanted Above for one reason or another are sent Below. One day, now veteran Headhunter, Jack Wade, took a call to investigate an intrusion to the upper levels. Facing the trespasser, Jack saw a potential in the girl and instead of turning her in, he gave her a second chance... to become his apprentice. Jack is back, but this time, he's not alone but accompanied by his sidekick Leeza X. Together, they will face whatever threat lurks from the world Below. The gameplay is set in 3rd-person view with ability to rotate camera or set it behind your back at the single click. Headhunter's main accessory is IRIS (Intelligent Realtime Information Scanner). Once you get the IRIS, you'll be able to scan every item just by pointing the gun at it, or use the scanner in 1st-person view which will let you examine the surroundings in more detail. Also, IRIS will provide you with a full 3D map info even displaying the enemies so you can avoid them or use stealth if necessary.

The game also features full destructible robot enemies, a wide range of weapons and a robust range of online multiplayer options.  Binary Domain puts players in the middle of a fast paced and intense battle for humanity against androids called the \"Hallow Children\" in 2080 Tokyo. Fighting through the derelict lower levels of the city, players control an international peacekeeping squad that soon starts to question their surroundings and the choices they make, especially as they realize that the androids appear to think that they are human and they witness the dramatic divisions within society. In the face of this struggle the question becomes, are these these robots becoming more human, or are humans becoming more like machines?  Players assume the role of Dan Marshall, the leader of a multinational squad of commandos known as the \"Rust Crew.\" The different characters of the squad each have different skills and personalities which must be exploited. Players are always Dan, but also command all other squad members, communicating with them either through a headset or via their controller. As players progress through the game they build dynamic relationships with AI squadmates based on the overarching cause and effect component of the game known as the Consequence system. Within the Consequence system, the player's actions determine the amount of trust each squadmate has in Dan. The Consequence system also affects the way that the campaign of the story plays out, with the use of different characters in different situations influencing events and outcomes."

        "daljsi_opis": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an online first-person shooter in which the player joins up with either a group of terrorists or the counter-terrorists (SWAT). The two groups then fight it out in a number of rounds. A round ends when all the members on a team are dead or if a team completes their goal. The teams are then awarded with money and the next round starts. Money can be used to purchase new weapons and equipment at the start of each round. If you die, then you will lose the equipment you bought in the next round. Aside from playing online, the player can also decide to play an offline game with AI-controlled bots or go through a weapons course. It is the fourth main game in the Counter-Strike series and features many gameplay elements and maps from Counter-Strike: Source and earlier versions, but with an improved visual style. It is also the first game in the series to be available on a PlayStation platform. The game modes include: - Arms Race: the player can't choose weapons, but starts out with a basic one. Killing an enemy yields him the next weapon on the list and the game ends when the player makes a kill with the last weapon on the list (a knife). - Classic Casual: the terrorist teams needs to either plant a bomb or guard a number of hostages while the counter-terrorists try to free hostages and defuse the bomb. - Classic Competitive: same as regular Classic mode, but the player will have to buy all his equipment and not just the guns he wants. - Demolition: similar to the Classic mode but on a much smaller map with usually just one specific area to focus on. The weapon system is similar to Arms Race where newer and better guns become available gradually."

        "daljsi_opis": "Resident Evil: Director's Cut is a reissue of the original Resident Evil. Unlike Resident Evil for the GameCube, it is not a remake of the original game, instead, it is more of a slight remix. There are three gameplay modes available. \"Original\" contains the original game with no changes or additions. \"Beginner\" features double the amount of ammunition and save ribbons, plus increased health for the player, increased damage for their weapons, and an auto-target feature. \"Arrange\" mode is the \"Director's Cut\" version of the original. The default outfits for Jill, Chris, and Rebecca are changed, new camera angles are introduced, and the placement of key items is changed. Most of these changes are designed to play against the expectations of veteran players of the first Resident Evil - so zombie dogs may smash through new windows, or keys will not be where they were, forcing players to hunt for them anew. The default Beretta pistol is also changed to a chromed version with a randomized chance to kill standard zombies in one shot. The original release of the Director's Cut advertised an uncut version of the opening cinema, in full color, and never-before seen. Notable aspects of this video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by these dogs. Chris is also shown smoking in his introduction, which was cut from Western releases. However, only the French and German releases contained this footage. U.S. and UK versions retained the censored black-and-white video shipped with the original release. This has never been corrected, either in the Greatest Hits reissue, or with the PSOne Classics downloads on the Playstation Network. The original issue of the Director's Cut contained a demo of Resident Evil 2 on a second disc. The \"Greatest Hits\" re-release added Dual Shock support for the controller (left \"movement\" stick only)."

Bionic Commando Rearmed preserves the original's mix of swinging and shooting in an intense 2D side-scroller, all to the tune of a brand-new soundtrack based on the classic 8-bit music from the NES masterpiece.

Faithfully sticking to the story of the NES game, Bionic Commando Rearmed tells the story of Nathan \"R.A.D.\" Spencer's first mission, sent in to retrieve captured agent Super Joe from the hands of the Imperials. Fans of the original story can expect to see all the characters from the NES version, as well as the memorable moments that made the title so popular with fans.

But the prophecies tell that after 1000 years, a Dark Messiah - half human, half demon - will return to the earth to destroy the barrier that stands between the worlds. Now twenty years ago, a Demon Lord successfully mates with Isabel, Queen of the Griffin Empire and all attempts of the Emperor to exorcist her fail (you can play this mission in Heroes of Might and Magic V) and the Dark Messiah is born. Also he doesn't know it yet, his goal is to obtain the Skull of the Seventh Dragon called Skull of Shadows from Skull Island, where it is guarded by the orcs and destroy the barrier between the worlds with it. The name of the Dark Messiah is Sareth and he's a mage apprentice. One day, his master sends him to Stonehelm to help another mage retrieve the Skull. And so the Prophecy seems to become real. But it is yours to decide if you use the Skull, once you've obtained it, for good or for evil since you are playing Sareth. Dark Messiah: Might and Magic is a first-person action game set in the medieval age so instead of guns you use swords, bows and magic to defeat your enemies. As you progress through the story you obtain skill points which you can invest in one of three skill trees called Combat, Magic and Stealth. How you skill Sareth directly influences the combat in the game. You can either play like an assassin and backstab your enemies to oblivion or make him a perfect sword-fighter who can use different combos to take out his enemies for example. But you can also use your environment to make your kills. There are countless items you can lift and throw at your enemy or you can light up your arrow on a campfire nearby to inflict more damage. You can also make good use of your foot and kick your enemies off cliffs or kick them into spikes that come out of the wall or use other traps that are scattered in the levels like bringing a statue to a fall. The main innovation in Dark Messiah is the so-called Body Awareness System. This basically means that Sareth is a real part of the world, like every other NPC. This makes not only the whole combat more intense because your whole body moves with every sword-swing you make but the NPCs can interact more directly with you. For example, an Orc can take you by your neck and throw you through the room. If you've already saved (or damned) the world, you can turn to the multiplayer-mode. There you've access to five different character classes from the knight to the priestess. With each kill you make, you earn experience points and increase in rank. Then you get skill points you can invest in your skill tree to get new talents or upgrade existing ones. This is most important in the Conquest game-mode, in which you play various maps in a row and keep your level between all the way. In the Conquest-mode, two teams (Humans and Undead) fight over the possession of the flags on a map. Once one team holds all flags, it wins and the next map is loaded. But there's also normal (Team-)Deathmatch available."

        "daljsi_opis": "The events of Alice: Madness Returns begin where the previous game American McGee's Alice left off: desperately struggling with her own mind, Alice is now in an establishment for children with psychological problems, and memories of her whole family dying in the fire haunt her. Now another threat - which appears as a giant train - seeks to destroy her Wonderland. Alice will battle through stages to stop the train and find out its true meaning. There are five large chapters in Wonderland, each with different themes and different types of enemies. The gameplay can be described as 50% platform-jumping and 50% hack-and-slash combat. Unlike the previous game, the emphasis is on fighting with melee weapons, although there are also means (and necessity) to shoot enemies. Melee attacks are strung together with a vorpal blade (quick attacks) or a toy horse (slower, but more powerful and able to break through enemy defenses), and a pepper grinder or tea cannon is used for ranged attacks. The grinder has a cooldown time and can also be used to activate switches from a distance. Alice has a timed bomb as well and can dodge incoming attacks by briefly turning into a cloud of butterflies. A focus mode can be triggered to keep a specific enemy in view and in this mode Alice can deploy an umbrella to reflect incoming projectiles. When she is low on health, a monochrome hysteria mode can be triggered where much more damage is dealt and Alice can harvest enemies for health instead of teeth, the main currency left behind by enemies. For the many platform sections, she can triple jump in the air and glide down. During her travels, Alice will visit both XIXth century London and imaginary worlds. One of the novelties of the game is Alice's ability to shrink herself anytime, allowing her to enter small pathways and detect otherwise virtually invisible platforms and objects. It is also used to receive clues about the next goal. From time to time, players need to complete various mini-games, such as a 2D side-scrolling platformer, a rolling ball game in both 2D and 3D, and side-scrolling levels with a submarine. Some characters from the previous game make their appearance here, and the game also introduces several new creatures from Lewis Carroll's novels. It is a single-player game only. Alice's weapons are upgradable three times with new abilities and stronger attacks, by using teeth that she collects on her journey. A total number of roses that stand for Alice's health bar can also be increased by finding and completing special challenges called 'radula rooms' and by solving Cheshire Cat's riddles. There are a lot of hidden objects to find, such as various memories and bottles; collecting them will unlock certain galleries in the game's menu. A New Game+ option with increased difficulty is available once the game is completed."

All the missions are completed by the four mercenaries working together. The available ones are Barney Ross, Hale Caesar, Gunnar Jensen and Yin Yang. The game can be played cooperatively with up to four players, both locally and online. When playing alone, the other ones are controlled through the AI, but it is possible to switch characters at any moment. The game consists of four chapters, each with their own setting, further split up into different levels. The environment includes the Balkan countryside, the Somalian desert, the Kowloon industrial docks and the Burmese jungle. There are two difficulty levels and also a number of challenges unlocked gradually next to the main campaign. The game uses a zoomed out, non-fixed third-person view with cinematic angles that cannot be controlled by the player. During the over-the-top action, the characters are controlled as in a twin stick shooter for movement, rolling and shooting. It is possible to switch weapons and pick up new ones from fallen enemies. Next to regular guns there are knives, machetes, grenades and bazookas. When up close, it is possible to grab opponents or perform a signature kill finisher, different for each character. Characters can also revive each other. Many parts of the environment are destructible, and some parts can be used for over. Vehicular combat is sometimes possible by riding motorbikes or driving 4x4s. There are some on-rails sections played from a first-person view, shooting enemy on the ground from a helicopter or an airplane. Most of the missions consist of advancing through the environment and eliminating many waves of enemies. Sometimes specific types of objectives need to be destroyed with a time limit. Characters gain experience during missions and have access to specific weapons and skills. Experience can be used to upgrade weapons, for instance to make the reloading time shorter."

After leaving New Orleans, Gabriel moves to the Ritter Castle in Bavaria, Germany, his family heritage. One day, a group of peasants approach the castle, and the elder tells Gabriel about a terrible death of a little girl, who was killed by a vicious wolf. Suspecting the wolf could be a supernatural creature, the peasant asks the Schattenjaeger to purge the evil. The investigation brings Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura to the mysterious Hunter Society and to Bavaria's dark past. The game utilizes a cast of live actors and full-motion video technology: the actors are filmed over photorealistic images of Munich and its surroundings, and nearly every interaction with the environment leads to a FMV sequence. Despite its visual style, The Beast Within is not an interactive movie, but a full-fledged adventure game with many dialogues, detective work to do, and puzzles to solve. Unlike the first game, it is entirely controlled through point-and-click actions - all the icons have been replaced by a single cursor. Both Gabriel and Grace are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story."

After escaping the island in the previous game, the four immune survivors (Logan Carter, Sam B, Xian Mei and Puma) land on an aircraft carrier controlled by the Australian Defence Force. After meeting some other characters, the ship is overrun and after it crashes down the four land on the island Palanai, which is also affected by the infection. As the four survivors struggle to get off the island, they also become involved with finding out the cause of the outbreak through Frank Serpo, the local researcher, Dr. Kessler, and the WHO researcher, Harlow. Players can choose any of the four survivors, each with their own abilities (even starting with a save game of the character from the previous title), or control the new character, John Morgan, who is also immune. He has a powerful kick attack that is very useful in close combat situations. The gameplay is largely identical as the survivor roams the surroundings, defeats enemies and gathers tools and weapons that can be customized and upgraded. The tropical setting is retained, but the surroundings are diversified through towns, cities and jungle. Water also plays an important role now, with large areas and cities that are flooded and many parts that can be traveled by boat. Characters can still move by foot or use a vehicle. Next to the regular quests that mainly require the character to fetch items, there are hub defense missions where a certain area needs to be barricaded and defended for a set amount of time. The game offers new weapons and customization options, as well as new enemies. Unlike in the first game, firearms are available almost right away. Thus, the player has the choice to play it as a first-person shooter rather than a brawler like the first game emphasized on. Throughout the game, experience is gained to develop combat abilities through a skill tree next to the modified weapons. Characters also still have access to fury attacks that provide additional perks as long as the meter does not run out. Just like in the first game, the player is free to explore in any direction, but opponents level along with the main character to match the abilities. In addition to single-player, the game can once again be played cooperatively with up to four players."

        "daljsi_opis": "Unreal Tournament is completely different from Unreal: it is now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3. At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point. The fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack. All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added."

With each battle executing a new level of involvedness, the fighters themselves have become more complex in their design. In Dead or Alive 5 players will be able to feel more involved in the action as they see their fighters sweat as they exert more energy. Players can also kick up the competition in online multiplayer modes where fighters must learn to utilize their strength and weaknesses to K.O. challengers."

The powerful Hyperion Corporation, led by Handsome Jack, secured a moon base and eventually occupied the entire planet, depriving it of Eridian. One day, four vault hunters fall into a trap prepared by Jack, but are rescued by a ClapTrap robot and shown the way to a resistance movement that tries to put an end to Hyperion's regime. Borderlands 2, like its predecessor, is a first-person shooter that incorporates character building, quests and procedural content generation elements from role-playing games, particularly roguelikes, along with vehicle-based gameplay from contemporary shooters. The sequel features four new characters embodying four classes that represent different special skills and weapon affinities. Accumulated experience points result in skill points, which can then be allocated to the nodes of one of three skill trees that vary between classes. Weapons differ not only by type, firing speed or damage, they can also cause elemental damage that is more or less effective against specific types of opponents. Players can take on the game's challenges by themselves, or enlist the help of other players in the cooperative multiplayer mode. Compared to the first game, the game world is not split into disjunct pieces anymore, but has become continuously connected. Non-player characters now follow their own schedules and agendas as opposed to being fixed in their position permanently."

        "daljsi_opis": "Bulletstorm is a fast-paced first-person shooter. Players take the role of Grayson 'Gray' Hunt, the captain of a space pirate crew made up of former soldiers from the elite army unit Dead Echo. Ten years before, during an assassination job, they discovered the sinister motives of their commander General Serrano. The unit's job was cleaning its tracks by eliminating opposition parties, this time a journalist with compromising documents on the general. Flash forward to today, when the company accidentally comes across the Ulysses, a space ship with their former commander on board and a drunken Gray decides to eliminate the vessel in a suicidal attack. Both ships crash onto planet Stygia; formerly a resort destination but now a deadly environment, populated by mutants of all sorts. His brother in arms and the second person to survive the \"landing\", Ishi, was terribly injured and needed a cyborg transformation operation in order to survive. Gray blames himself for everything that has happened and promises Ishi to get him off planet and to a decent doctor. The gameplay is based on a skillshots system. When an enemy is killed with certain conditions, like thumping them onto spikes or decapitating them with a headshot, the player gains skillpoints. The more skillshots done simultaneously, the larger the reward is. Skillpoints are spent on dropkits for weapon upgrades, like alternative fire mode and ammo capacity increase, and ammunition. Though the arms are quite unique (drill gun, bouncing spheres grenade launcher), the most useful skillshot utilities are the leg and energy leash. Leg lets the player kick enemies into the air, slow down time, or control enemies in close range. Leash allows a bit more: pulling up enemies and weapons toward the player or thumping crowds sky high. Also, they allow interaction with some objects, such as obstacles. Like in most contemporary shooters, there is no health bar. Players just wait until the blood covered screen clears up and Gray is healed. Levels are divided up into different checkpoints. The game modes are not limited only to single player story campaign. Echoes is a level replay mode stripped of cut-scenes where the player is encouraged to finish as fast as possible and compete with other players' scores on online leaderboards. Anarchy is a four-player cooperative mode where enemy waves need to be repelled, achieving certain scores to access the next wave up to 20."

        "daljsi_opis": "Darksiders II is an action-adventure game and the sequel to Darksiders. It takes place parallel to the first game where War, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, went to Earth after he was stripped of his powers and in tricked in causing a war between heaven and hell. His brother Death is convinced of his innocence and sets out at the same time to resurrect humanity and prove his brother's innocence. He travels through different lands and locations to restore the mistakes and kill those responsible. The gameplay with its third-person hack-and-slash is similar to the first game. The environments consists of large open world areas where dungeons lead to new locations. Death can travel the distances on foot or using his horse Despair. Another character is the raven Dust that helps locate objectives. Both can accessed by the player through a key or button. Fast travel is available as well and it is possible to return to the overworld from inside a dungeon, saving progress there, to continue later. Next to the action there are also still many environment-based puzzles that require the manipulation of levers, tiles, pressure plates, doors and portals to progress. A lot of time is also spent on exploring and navigating the environment, including climbing using fixed points, running along walls and swimming. Compared to War in the first game, Death is much more agile and can perform acrobatic moves. Similar to the first game many more mechanics are unlocked along the way, such as the Death Grip grappling hook and the Voidwalker portal gun. Other abilities are Soul Splitter and Interdiction to control other characters, often to solve puzzles. Many levels also have large boss characters with QTE-finishing moves. Death's primary weapons are dual-wielded scythes (often traded in for better ones after time), along with various secondary melee weapons that provide a range of powerful but slow, or fast but lighter attacks. Attacks are based around striking, dodging and blocking combined with a lock-on mechanic. Later abilities also offer ranged attacks or the option to summon ghouls that fight along and can be made to explode when their health is running low. The three main resources are health, wrath and reaper, along with an overall experience meter. Wrath is used to activate special abilities and reaper allows Death to transform into his grim reaper form with much more powerful attacks. Just like the first game there is a light role-playing element as experience contributes to eight statistics along with an overall class level. When leveling up, a skill point can be spent in two skill trees to open up new abilities. Resources and the currency are gained by defeating enemies, looting chests or from vendors, and new items are also found that way. Next to the customization page for the primary and the secondary weapon, there are separate tabs for armor, boot glove, shoulder and talisman. New moves also need to be bought. Death also discovers possessed weapons that can be upgraded by sacrificing lesser weapons. Another resource is discovered through bluestones, hidden in the world. There are three types and they can be combined to be sold in groups of three to a character called Blackroot for permanent upgrades and abilities."

        "daljsi_opis": "The manly tough-guy stereotype is on the verge of retirement, over a decade after he saved the world from aliens in Duke Nukem 3D. America is awash in hero-worship of the man who conquered the aliens with movies, books, restaurants, and action figures (to name a few things) of their favorite muscle-bound action hero. One day, on the way to his own talk show, Duke learns that aliens have landed on the earth once again. However, this time their intentions seem to be unclear and Duke is asked by the president to restrain himself, for fear of offending the aliens and provoking another war. Duke reluctantly agrees - only to find out, much to his relief, that the aliens are hostile after all, which means that the pop culture icon is finally back to his old ways! Duke Nukem Forever is a first-person shooter that largely relies on the gameplay style of its predecessor, known for testosterone-fueled gunplay and humor. A few elements characteristic for modern shooters have been introduced: Duke has a health bar that refills over time, and carries only two weapons at a time, similarly to Halo. Duke Nukem also spends no time ducking behind cover, attacking, and bounding forward to cover in the way squad-based or tactical FPS titles do. Rather, players will charge through stages, running and gunning for most of the game. Beside weapons, Duke can use pipe bombs and laser tripwires to damage the enemies, throw items, consume steroids and beer to increase his strength and reduce the damage he takes, respectively, as well as use a jetpack to fly short distances (multiplayer only). He can also use a holoduke, which creates a hologram of himself, confusing the enemies, and activate the Duke vision if the area is too dark. As in Duke Nukem 3D, it is possible to interact with parts of the environment; some of these interactions bestow benefits to the protagonist, including permanently increasing his ego bar (substitute for health bar). The game also features various set pieces and levels that focus on driving, platform jumping, and light puzzle-solving. In certain levels Duke will shrink in size, and will have to overcome obstacles before he can be restored to his old self again. Other activities include driving a monster truck or a radio-controlled car, turret-focused gunning segments, mini-games (e.g. Duke Nukem pinball machine), massive boss battles, and the classic visit to a strip club. Of course, it just wouldn't be a Duke Nukem game if it didn't feature the Duke's crude, dry commentary throughout the game."

        "daljsi_opis": "Ten years have passed since the events in BioShock. The underwater-city Rapture has further deteriorated, with water breaking in everywhere and whole sections flooded by water. But as bad as the situation is, the city still isn’t empty. After Andrew Ryan’s death, his long adversary, the psychiatrist Dr. Sophia Lamb took over the helm – embracing her own cult, making the mutated splicers that roam the city her worshippers. In the middle is Delta, the first of the protectors of the Little Sisters better known as Big Daddies. Eternally bonded to one and only one Little Sister called Eleanor, daughter of Sophia Lamb, he’s damned to search the city and find her or die trying. The player slips into the mighty boots of Delta, making his way in a typical first-person-shooter-style through the city of Rapture to find and confront Dr. Sophia Lamb, who holds Eleanor against her will. The switch of perspective, in the first game the player was a normal human, also brings with it a few changes in gameplay. The most important being, that the player can now use both one of the eleven available plasmids and one of the several different weapons at the same time, allowing him to burn enemies while pumping them full of bullets. Other plasmids include “Winter Blast” which freezes an enemy or “Scout” which allows the player to leave his body and look around unnoticed. The weapons on the hand range from the famous Big-Daddy-Drill over a powerful double-barrel-shotgun to a grenade launcher. As in the first game, both weapons and plasmids are upgradeable. While the weapons just require the player to find a special workstation, upgrades for plasmids and tonics (granting passive effects) are bought at special vending machines called “Gatherer’s Garden” with the rare substance called “Adam”. As in the first game, the Little Sisters roaming the levels are the key to getting access to Adam. But since the player himself is a Big Daddy, the process is a bit different this time around. While the player still needs to kill the accompanying Big Daddy to get access to the Little Sister, he can choose to adopt it afterwards instead of just harvesting it. The Little Sister will then sit on his shoulder and look for Adam-infused bodies in the level to harvest them. Setting down a Little Sister to harvest a body will unleash hell as every splicer in the level will try to kill her, requiring the player to protect the little girl from harm until its finished collecting. Once a Little Sister has harvested two bodies, the player can again either harvest her himself, or free her. Either action grants him more or less Adam and at the same time may alert a Big Sister. As opposed to the Big Daddies, they are nimble, fast and very deadly. Another important change is the new hacking-mini-game which is the same in all versions now and requires the player to hit the green or blue spaces on a gauge with a constantly spinning needle. If he doesn’t hit the right field, he either gets a electro-shock or will sound the alarm. A successful hack on the other will lower the prices at vending machines or turn turrets over to the player’s side. The new mini-game also allows the player to fight and walk around while hacking as well as hacking from a distance thanks to the arrows shot by the hacking-tool. BioShock 2 features multiplayer for up to 10 players which was developed independently from the single player by a different developer and tells the story before the first game. By gaining ranks for kills and winning matches, the player unlocks access to additional radio messages advancing the story behind the civil war that raged in the city between the Splicers and Andrew Ryan’s security force. The available multiplayer-mode include Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, Capture and Hold, Capture the Sister and Adam Grab. The latter requires the players to collect and protect the sole Little Sister in the level in order to gain points. Capture the Sister on the other hand puts two teams against each other with one team trying to bring the Little Sister to a vent and the other trying to prevent that. Each mode also features the possibility of one player slipping into the role of a Big Daddy."

However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him. Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting environment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a \"use\" and \"turn around\" buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight RPG twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game. Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3D lighting as well as 3D backgrounds and characters, etc."

The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a \"M\" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release. As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various \"hot spots\" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, you have to restart the game from the beginning, or from wherever you saved the game."

By this time the UN, NATO and many national armies have been disbanded. A company called Mantel Global Industries controls the world's largest and most powerful military organisation, supplying all of their soldiers with a drug known as Nectar, boosting their combat abilities. Mantel's army is tasked with all peacekeeping operations which arise. After sending out Carpenter and his squad to the Boa Region of South America, in order to neutralize The Promise Hand, a group of rebels inhabiting the region, Carpenter soon finds out his mission is not what it appears to be. After an unexpected twist of events, Carpenter finds himself on the rebels' side, fighting against his former comrades. The two factions fight differently: as a Mantel soldier the player has the option of using Nectar, thus making targeting and aiming more precise and powering the player's melee attacks. After realizing that the Mantel army's goal of achieving peace is only a lie fed to the brainwashed soldiers, the player has different fighting abilities among the rebels, like playing dead, laying grenade traps and being able to cause Nectar overdoses on Mantel troops. These overdoses make the soldiers berserk, disorientate them and make them unable to distinguish friend from foe. The single-player campaign also features a cooperative option to play along with three friends. The multi-player features deathmatch, team deathmatch and an objective based assault mode."

Dwindling in numbers by the minute, the Earth and all of her citizens are quickly becoming ripe for invasion.

You can teleport between locations by finding teleport cards and telepads.

Three categories of attacks may be performed: Light attacks (acrobatic kicks and punches by using her pom-poms), Heavy attacks (furious chainsaw slashes), and Super attacks (used for killing zombies and saving classmates will fill up Juliet's star meter). Juliet also carries the disembodied head of her boyfriend, Nick, who was bitten by a zombie and hangs him with her skirt, can be used as a projectile device. Juliet can place Nick's head and attached on a zombie's decapitated head and allows the player to control Nick possessing the zombie's body while assisting Juliet. When the player completes certain challenges in the game, Juliet's chainsaw and skills will be upgraded, gaining new abilities as you progress further into the game. By killing many zombies, it can earn you two types of medals (which are used from an in-game shop called Chop2Shop.zom). The gold medals are used for upgrading the character's stats and buy new signature moves, while rare platinum coins can be rewarded for killing special zombies or Sparkle Hunting.

Once Desmond Miles is forced to stab his ally, he falls into a coma. He then returns to the Animus to retain his consciousness. Once in the Animus, he falls into a back door known as the Black Room. There he hopes to reassemble his fragmented mind, to awake from his coma. He can do this by connecting his mind by locating a key memory. Along the road to doing that, he starts to relive the later memories of Ezio. The new Grand Master of the Assassin Order, after freeing Italy from the Templar threat, questions his life as an Assassin, wondering how it would've been had he never been one. Ezio thus sets out on a pilgrimage to his predecessor's homeland of Masyaf, which he discovers has been overrun by the Templars. There he finds an ancient artifact, which is locked away, and can only be opened with five keys. The search for these seals takes him to Constantinople, where he finds out that there is an army of Templars forming in the city, threatening to destabilize the region. Ezio must follow in the footsteps of his spiritual mentor, Altaïr, to lead him to discovery and revelation. The game follows the series' open world gameplay. Though in this game there's a new addition, an item called the hookblade, which is used to zip-line across the city or grab enemies to yank them in for a combo attack. The hookblade speeds up navigation around the city by around 30%. As well as the hookblade, Enzio has hundreds of different bomb variations that he can use, which are crafted. The game also added and expanded upon the seizing districts of the city from the Templars. While capturing a district is really similar to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the Templars will try to capture it back. Enzio must defend the districts captured by using a tower defense minigame, where he controls assassins from rooftops against waves and waves of Templar soldiers and siege equipment. The game is playable in 3D across all platforms, PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, with the console versions being able to support both stereoscopic 3D mode for 3D TVs and 2D for HDTVs. All Revelations gameplay and cinematics also have S3D support. Multiplayer is also present. The mode expands upon the basics of online modes from Brotherhood with new characters and locations. Players can customize their appearance and weapons, additionally they can start a guild and create a unique coat of arms. Matchmaking and user interface also have been improved. As well, players level up in the multiplayer game, and when they do, they move up in their Abstergo Templar rank and gain access to more information about the company. New multiplayer modes are added to the already existing ones, including \"story oriented quests\", as well as Capture the Flag. Some multiplayer maps are based on the island of Rhodes. Among the new additions is Deathmatch, which is different in the way that there is no compass pointing towards an assigned target, instead, there is a box on the top right of your screen where the current target is displayed. It glows blue when the character is in line of sight of the target."

However, one of the scientists unexpectedly switches sides, asking Desmond to put his trust in her hands and follow her out of the complex. Soon afterwards they escape the holding place and team up with some new allies that intend to use Desmond's knowledge against the Templars. Their new device is called Animus 2.0, an upgraded version of the original. This time, Desmond relives the life of Ezio Auditore di Firenze, a man who lived in Italy in the 15th century. Ezio is a boisterous, seemingly carefree young man who likes to pick fights and chase skirts. But all that changes when his father and little brother are publicly executed by a man he trusted. Driven by vengeance, Ezio begins to discover more about his father's life, and realizes that he, too, belonged to the organization of the Assassins. Ezio becomes a skillful assassin himself, and is ready to go all the way to avenge the death of the people he loved. Assassin's Creed II is a free-roaming action game very similar in concept and gameplay mechanics to its predecessor. The events of the game take place in Florence, Venice, Rome, and other locations in Italy. Besides fictional characters, the game has famous historical figures from the time period, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Niccolò Machiavelli, Cesare Borgia and others, who play an active role in the game's story. Authentic cultural and political environment of the Italian Renaissance is represented in the game along with fictitious accounts of the events, alternate history, and metaphysical theories. The core gameplay resembles that of the previous game. The protagonist can freely explore several large cities and rural locations on foot or on horseback. It is also possible to swim and navigate boats in the game. Nearly every building can be climbed on, and the protagonist can access the tallest rooftops, observing the panorama with his Eagle Vision. Free-form jumping and running occupies a considerable portion of the gameplay. One of the sequel's most notable additions is the financial system, which was not present in the first game. Items, weapons and armor can be bought in shops and repaired for money. There are many more weapon types and individual weapons and armor in the game. Ezio can carry swords, daggers, throwing knives, smoke bombs, a pistol, and a variety of upgradeable armor types. Weapons can also be picked up from fallen enemies and used in the same battle. Abundant treasure can be collected from various spots in the game world. There are new ways of being stealthy in this sequel. Ezio can pay courtesans to distract guards, hire mercenaries to fight them, or commission thieves to create a distraction. Mission objectives and particularly the steps needed to accomplish them are noticeably more varied than in the previous game. The protagonist often receives new equipment and new challenges to experiment with. A few of these are built like mini-games: for example, at one point Ezio will pilot a flying device. The main character has his own headquarters in the game, a mansion and a small town adjacent to it. It is possible to invest money into the town's reconstruction, as well as customize the mansion. The game features a significantly larger amount of side quests than its predecessor. A series of sub-quests involves locating, collecting and deciphering ancient words of wisdom that supposedly hold the secret of the universe. These quests often involve traversing complex indoor platform environments in order to reach the goal. These sequences require precise jumping and contain light puzzle-solving elements, similarly to contemporary Prince of Persia games."

A group of American soldiers, which includes the protagonist, Captain Nathaniel Renko, goes to investigate, when another surge disables their helicopter. After they crash land on Katorga-12, Renko begins to phase between the present and 1955, the date of a catastrophic accident on the island. He arrives in 1955 in time to save a scientist named Nikolai Demichev from dying in a fire. As he rescues Demichev, a man tries to warn Renko not to save him; the man is then killed in the fire. Back in the present, Renko discovers that Demichev has taken over the world. He is captured by Demichev's soldiers, but is rescued by Katheryn, a member of a resistance group called Mir-12. Based on a journal they found on Katorga-12, they believe that Renko can put an end to Demichev's reign using a time manipulation device called the TMD, developed by Victor Barisov. Barisov was killed by Demichev long ago, so Renko uses the TMD to save Barisov. Back in the present, Renko and Barisov determine that they can set history right by returning to 1955 and destroying Katorga-12 with a bomb made from Element-99, the material that caused the catastrophic accident in 1955. Renko and Katheryn manage to find such a bomb, but Katheryn is lost as they retrieve it. They use the bomb to destroy the island, and thus, the research facility that Demichev used to become so powerful. Back in the present, Renko finds Demichev holding Barisov at gunpoint. Demichev reveals that he rebuilt the facility after it was destroyed, so that history remained unchanged. Barisov realizes that it was Demichev's rescue that changed history, so he asks Renko to go back and stop his past self from saving Demichev. Demichev, in turn offers Renko a place in his empire in exchange for the TMD. He also points out that Barisov's plan has failed before – the mysterious man who told Renko not to save Demichev in 1955 was Renko himself. At this point, the player has a choice. If Renko shoots Demichev, he goes back in time to stop himself from saving Demichev in the first place. In order to do so, he decides to kill his past self. In the epilogue, it is implied that Barisov recovered the TMD and used it to conquer the world himself. If Renko instead shoots Barisov, he and Demichev rule the world together. After some time, Demichev begins to fear Renko's growing power, and a cold war develops between the lands ruled by Renko and those ruled by Demichev. If Renko shoots both Demichev and Barisov, Renko allows the world to fall into chaos. Later, he rises up as a new world leader, using the TMD to assert his power. A scene then shows a wounded Katheryn, pulled into 1955 by a time distortion, writing the Mir-12 journal which will later be used to track down Renko."

It must be charged after use, with the charge represented by a pendant hanging from Afro's sword. As Afro kills enemies, he levels up earning new skills and increasing his power and stamina.

        "daljsi_opis": "What made Ray McCall put down his revolver and become a reverend in the town of Hope? A question Call of Juarez never answered. The successor, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood tells the story of what happened 20 years ago that dramatically changed the life of a fearsome gunslinger. The story begins right during the War of Secession with Ray and his brother Thomas as soldiers in the confederation. But soon they realize that their family at the farm in Georgia is in danger and they leave the army as deserters only to arrive home too late. Only their youngest brother, William, survived the attack. While he tries to give his brothers strength through faith, Ray goes on a rampage for revenge - pulling Thomas right with him down a dark path that in the end can only lead to the inevitable. At the beginning of a level, the player normally has the option to choose between playing either Ray or Thomas. Only in a few missions the game decides this. Choosing with which character to fight his way in first-person-shooter style through the levels greatly influences the gameplay. While Ray shoots first and asks questions later, he can neither climb over obstacles nor use bows or throwing knives for stealth kills. On the other hand Thomas could not even kick in a door if his life depended on it. So most of the time the two need to work together. Sometimes though the characters split up and the mission progresses differently for each one of them. In addition at certain points in the game the two use their coop concentration mode together, allowing them to simultaneously slow down time and use their two different special attacks to take down large groups of enemies. While Ray has to aim during concentration mode to unleash hell on his enemies afterwards, Thomas's cross-hair automatically jumps from enemy to enemy but requires the player to pull the trigger manually each time. Similar to the duels, in which the player needs to draw his gun in one move before he can fire, this is done by performing a virtual backwards pull with the mouse or the analog stick. To limit the access to concentration mode, its \"power\" needs to replenished by killing six enemies and only holds for a certain amount of time if not used before it vanishes. Besides the story campaign, the game also features a class-based multiplayer mode for up to 12 players. While no coop-mode is available, the players can shoot each other in Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Wanted. In Wanted one player takes on the role of a wanted criminal and needs to be taken down. The player that manages to put him to rest then automatically becomes the criminal himself. Manhunt builds on that premise by putting a whole team on the hunt for the wanted criminal for 60 seconds which himself is defended by a complete team. The last mode, Historical Events, pits two teams against each other where one team needs to fulfill objectives during a time limit (like blowing up a weapons cache) with the other team tries to stop them."

In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is similar to a series of murders across the United States. Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues. The game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have their own schedules. It has become known for its \"headline making strangeness\" and is considered one of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both extremely negative and extremely positive reviews and is seen by some as an example of games as art."

        "daljsi_opis": "Ninja Gaiden 3 is an action-adventure video game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo Koei. It is the sequel to Ninja Gaiden II and was released worldwide for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 in March 2012. An updated version titled Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge was released later that year, originally published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The game is the first in the modern series to be directed by someone other than Tomonobu Itagaki, the former franchise director. In his place are Fumihiko Yasuda and Yosuke Hayashi. Gameplay\r\nNinja Gaiden 3 features new mechanics and changes. Such new features include \"Steel on Bone\", a new visual cinematic trick which allows players to cut through the body during a slow-motion sequence. The new Kunai Climb involves Ryu climbing onto certain walls with the use of his kunai, which he can use to attack enemies from above. In other situations the player has to be stealthy, as Ryu can now sneak up on an enemy and kill him with a single strike. Enemies speak while fighting and do not die quickly, and they suffer and scream in pain when injured. They are no longer decapitated or dismembered, instead they just bleed and weaken. Some changes include the slide maneuver, which replaces the Reverse Wind Technique from the previous games. Ryu uses it to get through small passages as well as to attack enemies. The Ultimate Technique concept has slightly changed in the form of Ryu's cursed right arm known as the Grip of the Murder. When he kills a specific number of enemies his arm glows red. Then, the player can charge up for an ultimate attack that is fueled by absorbing nearby fallen bodies instead of essence. Unlike past games, the HUD appears only when Ryu is engaged in battle, then fades out later. The Muramasa store is no longer present; Ryu gets different swords over the course of the game. He also has access to his shuriken and a high-tech bow; arrows for the bow are also improved as the game progresses. Both projectile weapons have infinite ammo. Items are virtually non-existent. The Dragon Statues that allowed Ryu to save and heal are replaced by a scripted Falcon who swoops down to Ryu's hand and saves at specific points in the level, restoring his health to full as well. The Ninpo concept has been revamped. In the single-player mode, Ryu has access to only one Ninpo that transforms him into a giant dragon of fire. To activate it, the player must first defeat enemies to fill up a bar beneath the healthbar. Once it is full, the player can activate the Ninpo and kill all onscreen enemies at once, restoring Ryu's life in the process. The amount of health gained depends on how many enemies were left when the Ninpo was cast. In the multiplayer modes (both co-op and competitive), there are other Ninpo available, such as the Art of the Piercing Void. The PlayStation 3 version of Ninja Gaiden 3 has an optional control scheme for the use of the PlayStation Move. This is to give players \"a new visceral edge when battling and slicing through their enemy's flesh and bone.\""

Another ship is sent to investigate the causes of the signal; however, as it attempts to dock with the Ishimura, it crashes into it because of a system malfunction. The crew is attacked by terrifying monsters. Only three people survive, among them an engineer named Isaac Clarke. It looks like the ship is barely able to sustain its existence, many of its systems critically damaged. Isaac is the only one who would know how to fix them, and his two companions send him on a mission to find out a way to bring things back to normal and discover the truth behind the horrible events. Dead Space is a third-person sci-fi shooter with elements of survival horror. Controlling Isaac, the player explores the ship, fighting reanimated corpses known as Necromorphs. Combat heavily relies on the so-called \"strategic dismemberment\", which forces the player to cut off limbs or parts of the Necromorphs to defeat them. Wounding a particular part of the Necromorph's body may either allow the player to kill it, make it change attack patterns, or even become more dangerous. Many of the weapons in the game are improvised mining tools, such as a rotary saw, a plasma cutter, a hydrazine torch used as a flamethrower, and others. All the weapons feature a secondary fire mode; for example, the plasma cutter can be rotated to cut off vertical limbs more efficiently. Isaac can also use special abilities, allowing him to slow down enemies or pick up and throw items from a distance. A few sections in the game have Isaac float in a zero-gravity environment. Ammo and tools can be found during exploration or purchased in automatic shops available on the ship. Workbenches can be used to upgrade Isaac's weapons and armor."

The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business."

        "daljsi_opis": "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take-Two Interactive subsidiary, 2K Games. It is the fourth installment in The Elder Scrolls action fantasy video game series, following The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and preceding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Oblivion was first released in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A mobile phone version of the game was released in May 2006, and a PlayStation 3 version was shipped in March 2007. After a number of smaller content releases, a major expansion pack, Shivering Isles, was distributed. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition (a package including both Shivering Isles and the official expansion pack Knights of the Nine) was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A fifth-anniversary edition was shipped in 2011. Oblivion '​s main story revolves around the player character's efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the \"Mythic Dawn\" that plans to open the gates to a realm called \"Oblivion\". The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. Developers opted for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles. Development for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind. To design the graphics, Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant A.I. system, which enabled non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game features fully voiced NPCs—a first for the series—and the music of award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Overall, Oblivion was well received by critics, and has won a number of industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Within a month, the game had shipped over 1.7 million copies, and by November 2011, sold over 3.5 million. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide."

He is a demon hunter of over 500 years old who was cursed with immortality after he witnessed the murder of his wife by the hands of demon king Astaroth. This event turned him into a raging alcoholic who spouts vulgarities. In the modern days, where the game takes place, he hunts down demons for cash as a private investigator together with his cold, female partner, Arcadia Maximille. The storyline follows the events when they investigate a demonic invasion that nearly destroyed a city. Much of the game is built around the immortality, an unusual trait for a game character. Even though his physical appearance can be wounded or eviscerated, he can never completely be destroyed. While Bryce attacks hordes of enemies using a variety of firearms along with a sword, and dodges, blocks, and performs evasive maneuvers, his main worry is keeping his limbs together. Because of attacks and explosions, he often loses body parts that need to be walked or rolled over to reattach them to the body. When they cannot be found, the limbs also grow back over time. With body parts missing, Bryce is often weakened and cannot perform certain actions. When he is completely decapitated, the player controls the head and needs to roll back to the torso or wait for the entire body to regrow. At that moment he also becomes prone to death as small demonic creatures known as granbabies patrol the levels and consume body parts. When his head is swallowed, Bryce need to complete a quick-time event to get out again, or he is to remain a part of the digestive system. Removing body parts is sometimes needed to complete small location-based puzzles. At certain points of the game, Bryce takes further advantage of his immortality to set himself on fire to burn enemies or run electricity through his body as a conduit to stun foes. Players collect collectibles that are rewarded with experience points. These points can be spent to acquire new skills or update the existing ones. That way, his limbs can for instance explode. Multiplayer is supported through several cooperative and competitive challenges."

As in the previous games, the player-character leads the Third Streets Saints gang in a turf war against three rival gangs using a variety of weapons and vehicles in single-player and cooperative play. The series, and especially this title, is known for its crazy scenarios and lighthearted gameplay.[2] It was released on November 15, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and later abroad. Game development began by late 2008. There was high staff turnover from the previous Saints Row team with one-fifth of the final 100-person staff having worked on a previous title in the series. They aimed to improve on the series by giving the game a coherent tone, and found it in films such as Hot Fuzz and the game's signature sex toy bat. Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok physics engine. The game received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic.[3][4][5] Reviewers noted its general zaniness and praised its customization options. Critics thought the setting was insipid and that its humor occasionally fell flat, and others thought the game perfected the Saints Row formula. It was a nominee for Best Narrative at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, an IGN Editor's Choice, and a recipient of perfect scores from GamesRadar and G4. A complete edition including the three downloadable content packs was released a year after the original release, and its planned Enter the Dominatrix expansion became the game's sequel, Saints Row IV."

The game features a distinctive art style, quad-wielding weapons/demonic skill abilities, and a co-op multiplayer mode.  In The Darkness II players are taken down the brutal and personal path of Jackie Estacado, head of a New York crime family and wielder of an ancient and ruthless force of chaos and destruction known as the Darkness. The Darkness II stands out visually with its distinctive graphic noir style, and it is the only first person shooter to feature quad-wielding: the ability to simultaneously utilize four different weapons (2 weapons and Jackie's Demon Arms).  It's been two years since Jackie Estacado used the Darkness to kill the men responsible for his girlfriend's murder. He's been unable to shake the memory of Jenny's death since bottling up his supernatural power and now the Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie's life heralds the start of a full-scale mob war and opens the door for the Darkness to reemerge. The botched attempt sets Jackie on a journey to hell and worse as he unravels the mystery behind the attack and the motivations of the Darkness itself."

Their goal: the legendary vault which is said to be filled with treasures beyond imagination hidden on the planet by an ancient highly advanced alien race. One of those fortune-seekers is the protagonist, who has one advantage: the guidance of the Guardian of the vault. Borderlands is a mixture of a first-person shooter and a role-playing game. At the beginning of the game the player chooses between one of four characters: Roland: A former soldier. He likes to play with rifles and shotguns and has a Scorpio-Turret at his disposal to keep his back clear. Lilith: A Siren and Phasewalker. She can turn invisible and fights with extreme speed. Mordecai: A hunter. He prefers to snipe enemies from a distance and has access to a bird of prey called Bloodwing. Brick: A Berserker. He doesn't care much for guns and instead uses his fists to win all arguments. Each of the four characters has three different skill trees available, filled with talents that e.g. increase bullet damage or allow the player to resurrect a friend in cooperative game. The player gets one skill point to spend at each level up, which is earned through gaining enough experience points by killing enemies and fulfilling quests for the various NPCs inhabiting the planet Pandora. To kill all those enemies and survive the journey, the protagonist will find weapons, ammunition, useful items like shields or medipacks, upgrades and money on the enemies he or she kills, in chests scattered around the landscape, or purchased at vending machines. Weapons and shields come in different types of quality, can have several different types of attributes and mostly come with a level requirement. The maximum level a character can reach is 50. Since the protagonist has to travel around much, he or she has a buggy available armed with a machine gun and a rocket launcher or heavy machine gun at later levels. Since the game also features a drop in/drop out-coop-mode for up to four players, the buggies have enough room for two players with one using the mounted turret and the other driving around the vehicle."

The player once again takes over the control of Staff Sergeant Matthew Baker and his squads as they take part in \"Operation Market Garden\". With the goal to secure multiple bridges, three airborne divisions were dropped into the Netherlands behind enemy lines on the 17th September 1944 - one of which was the 101st Airborne Division, Matt Baker's unit. The game tells the story of him and his squad assaulting and securing Eindhoven and the subsequent defense of the surrounding area against the German counter-attacks. As in the previous games the player, in 1st person perspective or via tactical map, orders his squad around the map from cover to cover, ordering them to suppress the enemy and planning a flank attack to take the enemy position out, always advancing to the next objective. But to spice things up a bit, there isn't just an assault team waiting to be controlled. In some missions the player gets access to more specialised machine gun or bazooka teams. Especially the latter is very useful now since cover can be destroyed with enough fire power. There are also missions in which the player has control over a tank or has to fulfill the objective completely on his own. Like in Rainbow Six: Vegas the player can also now do a move called \"Dig in\" at each cover. This will switch the camera to a 3rd person view and make the character invulnerable to enemy attack (as long as the cover isn't destroyed). From this position he can blind fire or look over the cover to get the kill with the improved combat system which doesn't rely that much on flanking the enemy anymore since every part of an enemy can now be hit if it's visible. And if the player makes an especially impressive shot (long distance head shot for example), the game switches to a slow-motion action cam, showing the hit in every gory detail. Another change is the new health system. As opposed to a fixed amount of health, the characters now regenerate health automatically if not under fire. The game also features a team-based multiplayer mode for up to 20 players in which the teams either have to capture flag points or defend these points or eliminate the whole opposition to win the round."

Instead of riding slicecycles through zombies, Frank enters Terror is Reality to wrestle zombies. When the zombies are set free, and the town is caught in another outbreak, Frank, considering himself lucky, readies his camera, determined to break the story. The game isn't considered canon, since most of the main cast is drastically changed to keep the game interesting. Chuck Greene appears as one of the psychopaths, his daughter Katey does not make an appearance, and Stacey and Sullivan have new allegiances, for example. The game mechanics and goals are the same as Dead Rising 2: Frank must follow and complete cases within a certain time frame or the truth will vanish, he can escort survivors back to safety, and needs Zombrex to keep from becoming a zombie. This time, Frank needs Zombrex, and does not have to return to the Safe House to inject it. Off the Record returns photography to Dead Rising, and adds a new section of Fortune City, Uranus Zone. Additional combo weapons can be made, Frank's hand to hand fighting style differs from Chuck's, and Chuck Greene is the second player in co-op games. Another new feature in Dead Rising 2 is the sandbox mode, where players can roam Fortune City with no time restrictions and no need for Zombrex. Levels, skills and money gained in the sandbox mode carry over to the story mode, same as the money Chuck made in the TIR games in Dead Rising 2 saved to the story mode.

But when Spencer disobeyed an order from Gibson during Operation Blackout, which lead to the death of several TASC agents, Spencer was court-martialed and sentenced to death while through his actions the public changed its opinion about bionic technology leading to the cancellation of the program and the \"Bionic Purge\". During the purge all TASC personnel were ordered to turn in their bionics or have them forcibly removed. Some fled, others obeyed but in the end bionic technology was effectively removed from the nation - at least until terrorists from BioReign detonate an atomic bomb in Ascension City. With no military unit returning from Ground Zero once gone in, Nathan is spared his fate for now and is instead send in to deal with the situation under the promise to get new information about the where-abouts of his missing wife Emily. In a classic 3rd-person-shooter-style, the player moves through the destroyed city, fulfilling objectives like activating a relay station and thereby deactivating a minefield and killing the countless enemies (including mechs and other deadly vehicles) blocking his way. Literally always at his side: his Bionic Arm. While it can be used to just throw a nasty punch, the built-in grappling hook is the real clue on that device. It not only allows the player to swing around fast and even climb up the highest skyscraper, it's also a handy tool to get rid of enemies and for removing other annoying obstacles. At the same time Nathan also can use normal weapons with his right hands like pistols or grenades. Besides BioReign-forces, the environment itself is also an enemy to Nathan with radioactive zones killing him almost instantly. And due to the weight of his Bionic Arm, Nathan can't swim and will drown when he falls into water. To keep things interesting, the game features both collectibles and challenges. While the collectibles are simply hidden in the levels, challenges are offered once the player has done something, gains a new ability and such. The goals of these challenges include killing 25 enemies, making three consecutive swings or destroying three train wagons. Once a challenge has been met, the player immediately gains a bonus like better armor and often gets the same challenge again - only this time with increased requirements. The game also features a multiplayer-mode for up to eight player featuring Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch and Capture the Flag on small, mostly vertical maps allowing the players to make full use of the Bionic Arm the same way as in single-player."

The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghast Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Helghan War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces. Captain Jan Templar, the main protagonist, and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the ISA operative Hakha and the key in his possession. During the course of the game, Templar meets other characters who assist him such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy. Killzone 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009. Killzone 2 follows the events of Killzone and Killzone: Liberation, and is set entirely on the planet Helghan, the home-world of the Helghast who invaded an Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony. Two years after the Helghast assault on Vekta, the ISA has launched an assault on the enemy's homeworld of Helghan. The ISA goal is to capture the Helghast leader, Scolar Visari and bring the Helghast war machine to a halt. The main protagonists is Sergeant Tomas \"Sev\" Sevchenko, a battle-hardened veteran of the special forces unit the \"Legion\" assigned to Alpha team, who go on a mission to take out the Helghast threat. Captain Jan Templar has been promoted to Colonel and is the Fleet Commander of the New Sun, a Cruiser airship set up in the clouds of Helghan over its capital city, Pyrrhus, preparing for a final attack. During the invasion of Helghan, Sev's unit is deployed behind enemy lines to assist the main invasion force. Tasked with securing the enemy capital of Pyrrhus, Helghan's first true city, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are a more formidable enemy on their home planet. Not only have they adjusted to Helghan's hostile conditions, they have also harnessed the power of the freakish lightning storms that always occur on Helghan which they can now use against the ISA. A cold, barren, unforgiving world, Helghan provides a ready defense with thick, acidic air, dust clouds, and violent surgical lightning storms. Sev discovers his squad is not just fighting enemy forces—their fiercest opponent may be the planet itself. Killzone 3 was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2011 and is the only game in the series to feature a special edition, support the PlayStation Move, and utilize 3D gaming. It immediately follows the events of Killzone 2. Visari, the leader of the Helghast is gone, but the war is far from over. Helghast forces have mounted a devastating counterattack, prompting the ISA (Interplanetary Strategic Alliance) evacuation of planet Helghan. As new Helghast battalions appear, armed with more powerful weapons, ISA forces find themselves outmanned, outgunned and surrounded. Two new antagonists appear, Jorhan Stahl and Admiral Orlock, who both want to become the new Autarch of Helghan. Sev returns as the protagonist with Rico and Narville. Admiral Orlock eventually becomes the new Autarch due to a circumstantial decision by the Helghan High Council. In a final confrontation between Stahl and Orlock, Stahl murders Orlock, however, the planet Helghan and Stahls ship is nuked by Sev and his team. However, it revealed that a ship crash landed on Helghan and is greeted by two Helghan soldiers."

The player must reclaim cultist fortifications on the disaster-ravaged surface of the planet and defend colonists from hostile Martian creatures in the ancient mines and chasms beneath it and cleansing infestations from all structures. Using the Magnet Gun, Darius, the main protagonist, fires first at one object, then at a second object, and then the first object rockets toward the second. The Nano-Forge returns, having been passed down through two generations of the Mason family. Darius' father has incorporated the tool with a function that reverses any and all destruction dealt to man-made objects. The Nano-Forge will also feature an ability known as Impact, which discharges an incredibly powerful burst of force which can blow away structures and throw enemies off their feet. Darius' Nano-Forge, weapons and armor are all upgradeable, improving their efficiency, unlocking new abilities, and altering their appearances. At E3, Volition debuted the LEO exosuit, \"a robotic suit with powerful weaponry whose biggest strength nonetheless appears to be its ability to crash through structures with little effort. Darius piloted the LEO at full speed through a horde of aliens, splattering them on contact, and then brought down an infested building by crashing through its walls.\"[5] The game features co-operative multiplayer for up to four players, called Infestation, which features two different game modes, survival where you need to survive against waves of increasingly challenging alien attackers and defensive where you need to defend areas from attack. In a six-part YouTube series, the game's main storyline developer Leo and Max revealed \"Ruin mode\". This mode consists of nothing but \"blowing stuff up\". Players can either take all the time they want, or cause as much destruction as possible within one minute. The latter mode will have supported worldwide and friend leaderboards.[4][6] However, Ruin mode will only be available to players who buy the game new or purchase a code online, as players are given the choice to either play the demo of the mode or enter a code using the methods stated above."

The daimyou issue various missions such as assassinating a certain target, protecting a shipping crate with supplies, freeing captive peasants, or stealing resources. Once a mission is selected, players are dropped into a map filled with enemies and treasures to collect. They must utilize stealth and a variety of skills such as a grapple hook, silent assassinations, counter attacks, etc., in order to complete their objective. Once they level up, they can put attribute points into max health, attack, defense, an extended special attack meter that allows for the Zankoku attack (a teleporting silent kill), and a longer grapple hook.

Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. An OS X port was developed and published by Feral Interactive in 2013. It is the first video game based on both J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation released in 2001 (The Fellowship of the Ring), 2002 (The Two Towers) and 2003 (The Return of the King). This is because, until 2009, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to make games based on Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema films. In 2009, WB Games acquired the rights for both intellectual properties. The game contains narrative elements unique to both the novel and the films, although the aesthetic design is based more specifically upon the look of the films, with characters in the game bearing the likenesses of the actors who portrayed them in the films. The game does not directly adapt the story depicted in the novel and films, but instead depicts a trio of adventurers whose quest runs parallel to the main narrative, occasionally intersecting with it. The story follows them as they attempt to track down and defeat a powerful Black Númenórean named Agandaûr, who Sauron has employed to lay waste to the northern regions of Middle-earth, whilst Sauron himself concentrates on Rohan and Gondor. The game received mixed reviews, with critics praising the graphics and tone, but criticizing the repetitive combat, weak storyline and poor character development. It was also criticized for containing several game-breaking bugs. War in the North was a commercial failure, a fact many critics attributed to the timing of its release - several weeks after Dark Souls, on the same day as Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and ten days prior to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim."

        "daljsi_opis": "Crysis 2 is the sequel to Crysis and it is the second main game in the series, following the original title and the stand-alone expansion Crysis: Warhead. It is a first-person shooter where the basic weaponry is enhanced with a nanosuit that provides additional abilities, as featured in the first game. Many basic elements from its predecessor are borrowed, with the change of scenery as a notable difference; the game moves away from the jungle environment on a tropical island, as featured in Crytek's earlier title Far Cry as well, to a darker urban warfare scenery set in the destroyed cityscape of a future New York City in 2023, three years after the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Alcatraz, a force recon marine and a different protagonist than in the first game. New York City is ravaged and partially under martial law after an outbreak of the Manhattan virus that causes cellular breakdown. At the same time the city is struck by an infestation of the alien race Ceph, which was also present in the original game. Alcatraz is initially deployed as a regular marine as a part of C.E.L.L., a private military organization part of Crynet who developed the nanosuit. During the course of an early mission Alcatraz ends up by himself and meets the infected major Laurence Barnes who owns an updated 2.0 version of the suit. He passes it on to Alcatraz who consequently has to take on the Ceph as well as fight off C.E.L.L. soldiers, who assume he is Barnes because of the suit. Crynet hunts Barnes because he is an active biohazard through the infection and has stated criticism of the side effects that come along with wearing the suit. Most of the game takes place fighting through the city, but there are also minor parts where a vehicle can be driven. Next to melee attacks (stomping, kicking, punching), a large number of weapons and explosives, there is a large focus on the abilities of the nanosuit, as implied by the game's promotional slogan \"Be the Weapon\". The suit has a limited amount of energy that needs to be recharged regularly. The suit's four modes of the original game have been brought back to two. Aside from the default Weapon mode, players can access Cloak and Armor as the two main modes. Cloak provides invisibility and suppresses sounds, while Armor strengthens protection. The suit can further be customized through many modules that provide specific abilities. Speed and Jump are still presented as additional abilities, but they are activated automatically when the player sprints or holds down the jump button respectively. These, along with many other modules, are called passive secondary powers because they drain energy when they are activated. In the other, secondary Tactical mode, items, buildings and enemies can be tagged through a tactical visor. This leaves the player in a vulnerable position with no weapon, but consumes no energy. A major difference to the first game is that multiple suit powers can be enabled at the same time. Other abilities are hit detection (shows the general direction of incoming bullets) and different weapon attachments. The suit modes allow for different approaches to levels, based on brute force or stealth. A HUD shows a tactical radar with a basic map of the immediate terrain, nearby enemies, and a stealth meter that shows whether enemies are aware of your presence. Freedom of movement is more restricted than in the first game through the narrower city design, but there are many ways to progress through levels, and a larger focus on the verticality of the environment and using objects for cover and stealth, along with parkour-like movement that includes sliding and climbing up ledges. The included multiplayer modes support up to twelve players simultaneously. The game modes are Instant Action (free for all), Team Instant Action (team-based death match), Crash Site (steal energy from alien pods), Assault (nanosuit operatives must download data from terminals defended by black ops soldiers), Capture the Relay, and Extraction (extract alien bio-ticks from defended locations). The game supports stereoscopic 3D."

Although Kane is there to help him out, the deal goes bad. The game takes place in the ensuing 48 hours. As in the predecessor, gameplay revolves around cover-based combat, which is now activated manually with a button, as opposed to the automatic 'sticky' method used before. The player now also has the ability to grab human shields and use them as portable cover. In addition to this, there is a new throwing mechanism to hurl things at people. As such, it is possible to throw things like gas canisters in clusters of enemies, which can then be shot and detonated. Last but not least, the player can carry two weapons at once. The campaign can be played through in co-op mode with a friend on split-screen, or on dedicated servers; the second player assumes the role of ex-military man Kane. In addition to co-op, several other multiplayer modes are also supported. Fragile Alliance makes a return from the first game and allows a team of four to eight players to perform bank robberies, which consist of taking out the guards, breaking into the vault and making a getaway. Score is based on how much money the player personally gets away with, creating a recipe for betrayal. The Undercover Cop mode is a variation on the previous mode, in which one of the robbers is actually an undercover cop who must prevent the robbers getting away with the loot. The undercover player cannot be harmed by the security personnel, and cannot kill them either. The final mode is Cops and Robbers, which has two teams pitted up against each other, one taking the role of cops, the other taking the role of the robbers. The robbers should attempt to get the money and the cops should attempt to stop them. At the end of each round, the teams will swap places, and whichever team gets away with the most money wins."

Three weapon styles have over 100 deadly moves, each with its own gory animation. Bonus points can be collected by freeing hidden semi-nude slave women.

        "daljsi_opis": "Spec Ops: The Line is a provocative and gripping third-person modern military shooter that challenges players' morality by putting them in the middle of unspeakable situations where unimaginable choices affecting human life must be made. Spec Ops: The Line unfolds within the destroyed opulence of Dubai. Once the playground for the world's wealthiest elite, Dubai has fallen victim to a series of cataclysmic sandstorms. The city's ultramodern architecture lies half-buried under millions of tons of sand. The very sand that blankets the city plays a marquee role in altering combat situations and serves as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder players throughout the course of the game. While most people have fled the now-barren wasteland before the sandstorms swept through, U.S. Army Colonel John Konrad and his loyal squad remained behind to protect those incapable of escape. Unable to reach anyone in Dubai after the storm hit, the U.S. Army feared Konrad and his team dead until they picked up a weak distress signal and launched a rescue operation. As U.S. Army Captain Martin Walker, you and your elite Delta Force team are sent to infiltrate the treacherous region to bring Konrad home. Players will experience \"The Line\", that razor's edge known only to men who deal in war. It is the line they cross when death and duty become one and the same. It is the end -- of self and sanity -- when their duty is done and only they remain.      Deep, Mature Narrative: The story of Captain Walker's rescue mission will challenge players to make tough choices between what’s moral and what’s necessary, as Walker’s journey pushes him to his very limits.\r\n    \r\n    Blasted Opulence: The events unfold in a stunning, haunting setting – the remains of Dubai, once one of the wealthiest cities on Earth, now stripped bare. Dubai's bold and luxurious architecture still shines through, in spite of the sandstorms threatening all that’s left. Opulent interiors contrast sharply with the vertigo inducing heights and mass destruction outside of the extravagant structures.\r\n    \r\n     Dynamic Sand: Turn the tables on foes by crushing them under a cascade of sand cast down by a strategically placed shot – but beware of oncoming sandstorms and their gale-force winds. The sweeping sands of Dubai feel almost alive, serving as a powerful but unpredictable force that will both help and hinder the mission, while opening up a variety of new interactions and tactics.\r\n    \r\n     Brutal, In-Your-Face Action: Join forces with intelligent, resourceful squad mates in fever-pitched gun battles. Accessible combat and squad controls will get you in the fight quickly, where you’ll experience the raw destructive force of your authentic weapons as well as engage in extremely physical close-quarters battles.\r\n   \r\n     Endless Multiplayer: In addition to the single-player story mode, Spec Ops: The Line packs a full range of multiplayer features, including a never-before-seen mode with unique connections to the main story, a breadth of competitive and team-based modes, as well as the ability to rank up, personalize, and customize characters from two distinctly different factions."

The hero, now a member of the Inquisition, is sent out to find out how to stop the chaos caused by these creatures from the deep. His quest begins with rumors that the pirates who frequent the southern islands are the only ones who know a way to get rid of the creatures once and for all and end their reign of terror. With an all-new pirate-based theme, Risen 2: Dark Waters aims to combine the most loved classic RPG gameplay mechanics of the original Risen with a fresh theme and setting on a huge variety of themed island locales.

The God of War series, made up of God of War and God of War II, featuring the brutal yet tortured anti-hero Kratos, engrossing storylines based in Greek mythology, over-the-top addictive action and puzzle-solving gameplay and simple controls is often referred to as one of the best, and/or most popular single player action games series ever made for PlayStation 2. The truth in this can be seen in the fact that in an era dominated by more advanced game consoles, fans of the franchise who have held on to their PS2's still revisit these two games from time to time, while gamers who missed their initial releases are tempted to give them a try, even though they have moved on to a PS3.

        "daljsi_opis": "The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena includes two single player campaigns. One is a graphically enhanced version of The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and the other, called Assault on Dark Athena, continues the story almost directly after the end of Escape from Butcher Bay with Richard B. Riddick and Johns in hibernation on board of a ship deep in space. A group of renegade mercenaries finds them and brings them on board of their giant ship called the Dark Athena where they transform people into mindless drones. Of course Johns is a too valuable target to transform so they plan to collect the bounty that is on his head after he freed Riddick from the prison. Riddick on the other hand - well he managed to evade capture and is now really pissed. As in the first campaign, the player once again assumes the role of Riddick, controlling him a standard first person shooter fashion through the corridors of the ship. But Riddick isn't one who runs guns blazing through the enemies. Instead the dark is his friend. Hiding in the shadows he uses his special ability to see in the dark, sneak up on enemies and perform an instant melee kill with whatever weapon he has currently equipped. This not only applies to his melee weapons that range from his fists to the newly double-carved blades but called \"Ulaks\" but also to the bigger stuff he'll find on his journey like assault rifles, a mini-gun and such. If he hasn't a gun available, he can pick up a dead drone and use hers. At one point in the single player campaign he'll even take over the control of a full-blown mech to reek havoc on the ship as he did back in Escape from Butcher Bay. If an enemy manages to actually hit the player, Riddick can use NanoMED health units to replenish his health. Since these only have a limited amount of charges he can refill them with NanoMED Catridges scattered around the levels. The bigger NanoMED health units permanently increase his health. And on his way through the Dark Athena he also finds bounty cards, the equivalent of the cigarette packs Riddick collects in Escape from Butcher Bay, unlocking extra content like artworks or personal profiles. Completely new to the game is the multiplayer mode allowing up to 12 players compete against each other in several game modes including Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Arena. Butcher Bay Riot and Pitch Black. While the first three are self-explanatory, Arena puts up to four players in small areas in either one-on-one or two-on-two fights while everyone else is spectating and waiting for their turn. Butch Bay Riot on the other hand puts three teams against each other with each team buying their weapons, ammo and armor before each round. With the goal to bring the power node located in the middle of the map to the enemy base, the guards, prisoners and mercenaries don't really fight each other at once. Instead each group has one specific enemy. So the prisoners go after the guards base while the guards attack the mercs. The last game mode, Pitch Black, puts everyone in a dark area with one player playing Riddick with his dual-blades and his night-vision ability and the others all playing mercs only equipped with their weapons and flashlights hunting him down."

The result is a brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With a cover-up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo."

They are transported into The Sphere, an enormous, organic alien ship. Tommy is set free by one of the denizens and his task is to save his girlfriend Jen and grandfather Enisi, and find out what the meaning of The Sphere is. This 3D-shooter, based on a modified version of the Doom 3 engine, takes place entirely inside the gigantic ship. As a combination of organic and cybernetic structures, gravity is defied: with the proper grids activated, you can walk on walls and ceilings. There are also multiple dimensions inside the ship you can cross using portals. During his quest, Tommy struggles with his Native American lineage. The ghost-like hawk Talon is always on your side and you sometimes cross over to another land to get help from your grandfather. Tommy can also shift to Spirit Walk, an alternate dimension in the game to get past obstacles and solve puzzles. When you die, you are also transported to another realm where you have to shoot lost souls with your spirit bow before being sent back. Your new health and spirit status will be based on your performance there. The weapons Tommy uses are usually organic, with secondary fire functions. The arsenal includes a wrench, a rifle, crawlers, an acid sprayer, an auto cannon, a leech gun (chargeable with fire, ice, red orbs or lightning), a rocket launcher and the spirit bow. Certain parts of the game require you to explore large areas in a flying pod. You can use it to engage enemies or use the tractor beam to move objects. Navigation, often with a distinct lack of direction, is reminiscent of Descent then. Puzzles usually require you to decipher codes, activate switches and find entrances. The game supports OpenAL and EAX HD surround sound, and multiplayer games for up to eight players in duel or team deathmatch. Although the game is developed by Human Head Studios, it is produced and was originally designed by 3D Realms."

        "daljsi_opis": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on Microsoft Windows. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Set within the fictional Liberty City (based on New York City), the single-player story follows a war veteran, Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.[c] Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists. Development began in 2004, soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. Following its announcement in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated.[4] Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013."

        "daljsi_opis": "Dante's Inferno is an action-packed journey through the world of Inferno, based on the first canticle of Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. In this adaptation Dante is re-imagined as a templar knight, a veteran of the crusades, who comes home to discover his beloved Beatrice has been killed. At that moment the murderer stabs Dante in the back as well. Dante is however able to resist Death, who wants to take him down to hell, and robs him of his scythe. With these new powers he can descend into the inferno by himself to track Beatrice whose soul has been captured by the devil. Lucifer plans to marry her soul, which should have gone to the heavens instead, to flee from hell and overthrow God. To prevent this from happening Dante has to travel through the nine circles of hell and master their demons to finally undergo his toughest test. Matching the original Inferno theme of recognizing and rejecting sin, he has to face his own past, his own crimes and his own sins to free Beatrice. Through the journey he often meets the poet Virgil who explains the different circles and drawn flashbacks show how Dante sinned in each circle during the crusades. The gameplay is largely similar to the God of War games. Dante's preferred weapon is a scythe and he commands magic through a holy cross he carries which has been given to him by his beloved Beatrice shortly before her death. This magic utensil sends out rays of light that kills all evil it touches. Dante even can tame some demonic beasts and use these to his own needs. Players however have to choose between a holy and an unholy path. When grabbing enemies or encountering trapped characters (including a large number of historical figures) Dante can choose to punish or absolve them. Either choice is rewarded with unholy and holy experience points respectively. This allows Dante to level up in one of the two tech trees and spent the souls he has collected there. It is not possible to max out both sides, so a certain path needs to be chosen. The unholy side focuses on the powers of the scythe while the holy side focuses on the cross. With each level new abilities can be purchased. For the unholy path most of these are centered around stronger scythe attacks, while the holy path focuses on the ranged abilities of the cross. There are also general abilities such as expanding the health or mana meter, extending the redemption meter, or providing additional defence against attacks. Dante has multiple combo attacks, he can dodge, block and revenge, attack from the air, grab and throw enemies, and perform acrobatic stunts such as sliding down large spines, hanging and swinging from ropes, or clinging to specific walls. These stunts are often used to solve minor environmental puzzles. Fighting enemies also fills up a redemption meter, which can be activated when it is maxed out, granting faster movement and attacking speed. During his journey he will also master four strong forms of magic, also enhanced through the tech tree and those depend on a separate mana meter to execute. The currency to buy new abilities is souls of the enemies he defeats. Souls are gathered automatically when killing enemies, and both health and mana is largely replenished through shrines. Many large battles feature quick time events (QTEs) where the player needs to press the correct buttons when prompted, to defeat a large enemy. These also appear as a mini-game when you need to absolve souls of major characters."

Suddenly, a powerful magician named Roger Bacon tries to capture Alice, since she bears the secret to unleash a forbidden incantation, one that could burn the entire world to ashes. Then, Yuri comes to the rescue and saves Alice. Thus, they must embark on an epic journey all across China and Europe, searching for the mysterious man who tried to kidnap Alice and unraveling a devious master plan of apocalyptic proportions.  Something that makes Shadow Hearts unique from other RPGs, is the use of the Judgment Ring, which is not only rooted to our party's performance on battles, but also other aspects of the game like buying items. Our mastery with this peculiar system is crucial, since depending on what part of the ring we hit, we can deal more physical damage or, if we aren't skillful with the ring, fail to perform attacks or magic at all.  A hero with a mysterious past. A young girl holding the key to world domination. A villain who will stop at nothing to unlock the path to unlimited power. All this and more await you in a world of occultism, dark fantasy, and Gothic horror. Welcome to Shadow Hearts."

        "daljsi_opis": "The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is an entry in the long-running Frogwares adventure series about the fictional detective created by Arthur Conan Doyle. The game has no ties to any of the previous games and presents an original story not based on the writer's works. It is set in London, 1898, after Holmes just solved a case where precious jewels were stolen. Upon returning it however, the necklace turns out to be a fake and the detective himself becomes incriminated. On top of that, when he has an appointment with the Bishop of Knightsbridge and arrives there, the bishop is tied up and mutilated. While the player initially controls Sherlock Holmes, his strange behavior eventually will have the player control his fellow partner Watson, who needs to investigate himself whether Holmes is really implicated. The game is played from a third-person perspective but it can be changed to a first-person view at any moment along with a fully rotatable camera. The game can also be switched to a classic point-and-click view where clicking a desired location causes the character to move there. The gameplay focuses entirely on the investigations. The environment is presented as an open world with an open investigations where different locations can be chosen and leads can be followed or ignored. Because of the larger scale, characters are now also able to run to travel faster. Items that can be interacted with in the environment are highlighted with a magnifying glass. These can be inspected from up close for further examination or other actions, such as moving an item. Often a close look is required to pick up specific clues. For some puzzles additional tools are provided to get more information out of the evidence. Some of these puzzles have questions that the player has to answer after the examination to gain clues. Rather than wrong or right answers, the player's deduction changes how the evidence can be used afterwards. There are also physical objects to collect that are kept in an inventory. Clues are stored on a deduction board where they can be combined to form leads. Much information needs to be gathered through conversations, where different approaches are available to catch suspects off-guard. Other elements of the menu contain general documents that provide context, a summary of dialogues, decorations and honors, a map of London, and the ability to switch characters when it is available. When stuck, a \"sixth sense\" system can be used to receive hints. It lights up all items that can be interacted with at once and based on the chosen difficulty level, it has a period of cooldown before it can be used again. For inexperienced players solving the puzzles can be simulated."

Sail to multiple islands to seek out the legendary Golden Fleece, which has the power to bring back the dead, and enlist the aid of the ancient world's celebrated heroes to complete your goals. Structured like an action role-playing game, Rise of the Argonauts emphasizes violent, combo-driven combat sequences with the ability to switch weapons on the fly and unleash attacks that can decapitate and eviscerate foes with one mighty swing.  Instead of earning experience points to level up your character, the game involves acquiring new powers and skills by courting the favor of four gods: Apollo, Athena, Ares, and Hermes. Choosing specific dialog paths, slaying a particular beast, winning arena battles, rescuing people, and performing other deeds can unlock different tiers of talents under a particular god. Twenty-five skills are available under each deity, all of which are designed to enhance your combat techniques in various ways. Master the use of swords, spears, maces, and shields, and recruit the likes of Hercules, Achilles, Pan, and Atalanta to fulfill Jason's destiny."

The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge."

        "daljsi_opis": "One of the most innovative, imitated, and controversial video game series of all time returns to PS2 in this three-for-one bundle from publisher Rockstar Games. Since the runaway success of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, the GTA games have been praised by players and vilified by politicians. All three 128-bit generation GTA games -- Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas -- are included in this box set. Grand Theft Auto III casts players as a low-level thug in a grungy, New York-styled urban game world called Liberty City. Liberty City is made up of three districts, and in all, the game offers 72 different missions, many of which can be played in any order. As the player's character completes jobs available in one part of the city, other areas and assignments open up to him. Along with this purposeful design of an open-ended, non-linear storyline, many other features popular in earlier versions of the game return in this release as well, including a diverse variety of deadly weapons, busy streets full of self-involved pedestrians, and eight different radio station soundtracks to listen to while inside the vehicles. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City offers the same open-ended style of play as its violent, \"M\"-rated predecessor, but in an area twice as large as Liberty City, and with a completely different theme. Seemingly inspired by television's stylish crime drama, Miami Vice, Vice City takes place in the 1980s. Criminals wear pastel-colored suits, bikini-clad women relax on sandy beaches, and palm tree-lined streets are bustling with showy sports cars and zippy motorcycles. Like its immediate predecessor, San Andreas strives to provide a wide, deep foundation for its free-form criminal gameplay by setting the story in a slightly exaggerated representation of a familiar (if not glorified) American subculture. As Vice City seemed inspired by Miami Vice, and the pastel-decked, \"me generation\" ideals of the early '80s, San Andreas is set in a time and place suggested by films like Boyz N the Hood, Menace II Society, or Colors. Players take the role of Carl \"C.J.\" Johnson, who thought he had escaped the gangland lifestyle by moving away from his Los Santos home. When his mother is murdered, he returns to the neighborhood of his childhood, only to become embroiled with threats and danger from all sides. Editor's Note: The version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included in this compilation has been rated \"M\" by the ESRB, and contains no working remnants of the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" sequence found in the title's original release."

Armed with a Special Purpose Rifle that can be upgraded with various scope, ammunition, and shotgun enhancements, the hero arrives to find that a mysterious plague has broken out in the facility and caused all life forms to mutate into deadly and evil creatures. Players must eliminate the threat of the virus and the hostile creatures it has created, all without becoming infected. The game is played from a third-person perspective, and all of the environments are rendered in real-time, allowing the camera to cinematically swoop around for the best view possible. The camera can also be configured into a manual first-person view aim, allowing for extremely precise shooting as well as a guide to the general layout of the environment. Extermination for the PlayStation 2 derives its roots and plays similarly to the survival horror game Resident Evil, but in a new twist to the genre, players will have to worry about becoming infected with the virus that has swept through the Fort Stewart installation. The infection level is measured by a percentage, and once that percentage reaches 100 percent, a parasite begins to spread throughout your body. Your health is dramatically reduced and certain elements (such as water) decrease your health percentage greatly. If you do not get a special treatment known as the MTS and find a medical bed in the installation, the infection takes over and turns you into a zombie-like mutant."

Blazkowitz is the general after donning the general's hat, boots, and jacket. After seeing blood dripping from the edge of the jacket, the sailors realize that there's a spy on board who has killed the actual general. As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket.  He finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, and with them, makes it to Isenstadt."

The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 3, 2009, and for Mac OS X on December 21, 2009. Set in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a warrior, mage or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background who must unite the kingdom to fight an impending invasion by demonic forces. BioWare described the game as a spiritual successor to their previous Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. The game is played from a third-person perspective that can be shifted to top-down perspective. Throughout the game, players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and accompany the player throughout the game. BioWare described Dragon Age: Origins as a \"dark heroic fantasy\" set in a unique world. Its setting was inspired by The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice & Fire, and was described by BioWare as a mix between high fantasy and low fantasy. Development of the game began in 2002, and lasted over six years. BioWare employed more than 144 voice-actors, and hired Inon Zur to compose the game's music. Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system. It sold more than 3.2 million copies, and 1 million pieces of downloadable content. Its multiple year-end accolades included Game of the Year and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications. BioWare released an expansion pack for the game titled Awakening in March 2010, and two sequels, Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Inquisition, were released in 2011 and 2014 respectively."

There is however, a core quest, centering around rescuing the protagonist's sister, who is being held for ransom by mysterious forces who are scheming to open the tomb of Aziraal, the god of fire. The game does not utilize fixed character classes like other role-playing games. As the character gains experience and levels, it is possible to invest gained Attribute Points into any attribute, leading to a variety of game play styles and approaches. The world in which the game takes place is called Antaloor. While traveling through the game the player will encounter new teleports, caves, villages, and other locations, and these travels are recorded by the in-game mini-map. Teleports allow rapid travel between explored regions. Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures, though a number of commentators have lamented the clumsy controls when mounted. Death in the game leads to resurrection at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity.\r\nThere are various creatures in Two Worlds. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn, although most areas are densely populated. Beyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of his/her liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or devilishly evil and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests.

With a sensual yet realistic style, characters are rendered in incredibly lifelike detail. From smooth, lithe muscles to emotive facial expressions, every character comes to life. Characters can even perspire as they fight, with realistic depiction of wet skin, damp hair, and moist, semi-translucent clothing as the match progresses.  Along with a rich array of single player modes including story mode, DOA5 offers new online options with arcade-style matches, tournaments, and social features. Players can be paired into one-off matches or work their way up the leaderboards for the honor and prestige of competing in global tournaments, the resulting matches of which can be watched by any player as a learning tool."

In what initially seems an act of revenge for her execution, Gretchen curses Heinrich with immortality. At the same time, Dr. Faust, the game's main antagonist, creates hordes of monsters that terrorize the world. The mad scientist is responsible for the deaths of Gretchen and her fellow witches. Gretchen, intending to protect humanity, decides to confront the menace directly, by joining forces with the cursed executioner, Heinrich.

The fourth campaign can only be unlocked once gamers finish the first three, and it stars longtime series antihero Ada Wong.

Beowulf can chant with his band to boost the morale and max out damage out, triggered through a rhythm button mashing mini-game. There are more mini-games similar to the chanting throughout the game. Some appear right in the middle of combat while trying to grapple a large monster similar to sequences in God of War. Beowulf can lift enemies with brute strength and hurl them in any direction, even at other enemies. He can also alternate weapons by picking up new ones, lying discarded on the ground, or from racks of weapons that may be found in many places. Also in combat Beowulf can enter Carnal Mode that increases his strength but demoralizes Thanes, so players won't be able to use it frequently or the entire kingdom will be sad and dismal. In certain areas the player needs to find a path to continue, sometimes by climbing walls and grabbing small ledges. All characters are voiced by the original actors who starred in the film."

        "daljsi_opis": "Vampire Rain is a stealth game similar in nature to the Splinter Cell or Metal Gear series. Players are tasked with navigating their character through city streets, while avoiding the vampire enemies that patrol the streets disguised as ordinary human citizens. Players often have to take alternate routes, such as climbing onto rooftops or through alleys, to avoid enemy encounters. Unlike most stealth-action games, Vampire Rain places heavy emphasis on pure stealth. Enemies are extremely fast and can kill the player in two hits; the first hit usually immobilizes the player, giving the vampire sufficient time to land a second, killing blow. Additionally, for the first third of the game, players lack any weaponry that can kill vampires effectively without spending a large amount of ammunition. In effect, most attempts to initiate combat generally result in the player's death. Also, unlike most stealth games, there is usually no effective means to hide or escape once an enemy has spotted the player, which results in the player dying soon after being spotted. Successful completion of many missions thus generally requires total avoidance of enemies by figuring out the correct route to pass through the mission area without being detected. Later in the game, players are given high-powered weapons which prove more effective against the game's vampire enemies. Also, there are a few pre-scripted action sequences that involve fighting against multiple enemies, generally with the assistance of teammates or special environmental hazards. The player's arsenal includes a handgun, submachine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, anti-armor rifle and a UV Knife used to stab an enemy from behind for an instant kill. If the player collects enough \"Medals\" that are either placed in hidden or difficult to reach spots throughout the game as well as passing certain missions under certain conditions such as within a time-limit, without needing to retry from a checkpoint or without killing any Nightwalkers will reward the player with extra side-missions and challenges. Online multiplayer involves up to eight players in standard modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag, as well as the unique mode which allows one to become a nightwalker and fight opponents with extreme speed and power. All the firearms are available online and the gameplay is handled like in single-player."

The Linux and Mac OS X versions of the game were planned to be released as downloadable installers that work with the retail disc. Ryan C.

The original Unreal Tournament uses the first Unreal Engine, while UT2003 and UT2004 use Unreal Engine 2. Since 2004 incorporates all of the content from 2003, they are regarded as part of the same generation. UT3 is the third generation, as it runs on Unreal Engine 3, and does not reuse any content.[5] In March 2008, Midway announced that UT3 had sold over a million copies worldwide.[6] On May 8, 2014, Epic Games announced a new, free and crowdsourced Unreal Tournament title.[7][8]"

The units weren't all of a single purpose but were grouped by area of expertise, whether it was an interrogation unit, special boat force or some other requirement that needed special attention. Gameplay revolves around six distinct campaigns, each divided into individual missions. Play is somewhat linear (with exceptions) in that most missions must be successfully completed before the next can begin and, correspondingly, all missions of a campaign must be completed before advancement to the next one can occur. Each mission can require a team of up to four commandos, chosen from an international field of 40 available, each with individual attributes, abilities and specialties.  Hidden & Dangerous contains a total of 23 missions with changeable weather patterns (rain, snow and fog), varying objectives and real-time movement through diverse terrain and locations. The game requires 3dfx graphics acceleration and provides viewpoint options from either first- or third-person perspectives. The world of Hidden & Dangerous is not stagnant, as objects within the environment move and react causing active strategic and tactical planning. Up to four players can cooperate per team over a LAN or the Internet. The game comes with a wide-ranging arsenal of WWII equipment, weapons, vehicles and objects from communication devices to camouflage uniforms, explosives and sniper rifles. Hidden & Dangerous assigns and tracks a player's specific \"profile\" from the beginning of the game, updating and assigning scores for each mission, with the resultant ratings having an impact on future missions."

She is held captive in the floating city of Columbia in alternate version of 1912. During his travels Booker encounters different factions within the city who are battling one another. The Founders want Columbia to remain a city only for pure Americans while the Vox Populi think the city should be available to anyone. The setting is built around the idea of exceptionalism with a strong religious doctrine and open racism. Elizabeth is a key piece within this conflict and has a mysterious origin including her powers to cause tears in the fabric of space-time, exposing parallel universes. Booker and Elizabeth remain together most of the game and she acts on her own. She does not need to be defended, tosses ammo and silver eagle coins to Booker and can be asked to pick locks. They are hunted down by the spiritual leader Comstock and his troops, along with the giant mechanical Songbird. The game uses similar gameplay styles and mechanics found in previous BioShock games. Vigors give the player super powers to do a variety of things such as sending a murder of crows to peck away enemies or charming enemies to defend you. Another one is possession used to take over humans or machines to temporarily turn them into allies. Once the effect wears off, the possessed humans will commit suicide. Most vigors have multiple uses either as a direct attack or as a much stronger trap awaiting to be triggered. Booker can also be upgraded through four types of gear with permanent bonuses similar to the gene tonics in the previous games. Different types can be equipped according to the situation. The typical FPS array of weapons can be found throughout the game like pistols, shotguns, and rifles. One of the more notable weapons is the Sky Hook which can be used as a melee weapon to take down an enemy. Money can be exchanged at vending machines for upgrades and consumables. Items are found by looting barrels, desks and enemies. Vigors can only be executed when a sufficient amount of salt has been collected. The three main bars visible on the screen (health, salt and shield) can be extended by locating and using infusions. The story is also furthered through optional voxophones (audio logs) and kinetoscopes (film projectors). Skylines provide a unique way to move throughout the world. Using the Sky Hook, the player can attached to these lines and quickly slide in one direction or another. These can be used to escape overwhelming situations or used to reach higher ground to gain a combat edge."

        "daljsi_opis": "The political situation in the democratic monarchy of Arulco has gone from bad to worse. The country has been taken over through a coup d'état by Queen Deidranna Reitman, the wife of Enrico Chivaldori - rightful heir and son of late King Andreas Chivaldori. Enrico was reportedly killed in an assassination attempt during his trial for the murder of his father. Enrico however is alive and has contacted the Association of International Mercenaries (A.I.M.) to help him retake the island. Making contact with Miguel Cordoba, the head of the resistance team, A.I.M. will hire mercenaries and coordinate battle plans to control towns, organize militias in a quest to overthrow Queen Deidranna. Jagged Alliance 2 is an isometric, third-person perspective turned-based strategy game. The role-playing elements of the game refer to (mostly) character development. The game is also able to switch between two different styles: sci-fi or realistic modes. From a new game, players will use their laptop to review information and hire mercenaries. Following that, the political map shows a satellite top-down position of the island of Arulco. From the map, equipment and funds are managed, as well as a review of enemy movement, and planning can be made to capture towns, mines and other locations. From the map, mercenaries can be deployed into a specific sector. Hostile sectors and enemy counter-attacks initiate combat mode. The combat screen is where most of the actual gameplay occurs. Traveling in towns, exploring houses (with the purpose of stealing stuff of course!) and most importantly combat, occurs here. An encounter with an enemy team (either offensive or defensive) will prompt a battle in the area of contact. If on the offensive, players may opt to place mercenaries in favorable positions. Each team plays in turns, unless their action in interrupted by an opposing member. Enemies come in all shapes and sizes: enemy soldiers, tanks, bloodcats, and (in sci-fi mode) insect-like monsters. The team that remains alive will control the sector. In order to recapture the island, players must engage in town militia management. A defense system must be organized for newly conquered towns to defend against enemy troops. Only loyal towns however may have its population trained into militia (indicated by a green percentage on the town via political map). A maximum of 2 mercenaries may train militia in any given town. The militia has 3 different training levels: green, regular, and veteran. The first 2 may be acquired through training, while the veteran status may only be acquired through combat."

Dead Island features an open-world environment in a campaign that supports up to four players for drop-in, drop-out cooperative action.

Explore the island's urban areas, forests, mountain highlands, caves, beaches, and other locales from a first-person perspective, or utilize an over-the-shoulder view for melee combat.

The NON, with their vampish commander Mistress Helga (portrayed by Kerri Hoskins), have declared war on youth culture (anyone aged from 13 to 30) and have banned music, television and video games as well as magazines and are stricly forbidden.

This third-person action-adventure takes place 400 years after the events in the first title. Killed at the hands of the Sarafan lord, Kain is resurrected and must now regain his memory as well as his powers before he can mete out his revenge. As a vampire, Kain requires sustenance in the form of human blood. An onscreen blood meter (which doubles as Kain's health meter) drains continuously, requiring the antihero to feed on enemies or the hapless denizens populating the towns and villages in order to stay alive. Weaker enemies can be dispatched using his bare claws, while stronger enemies will be more easily defeated with the aid of clubs, axes, and long swords found along the journey.  In addition to standard attacks, Kain is also capable of performing grab moves and stealth-kills, both of which are highlighted by a short cut-scene showing the gruesome death of his victim. Cinematic cut-scenes also introduce the game's many characters and flesh-out the plot. While Kain's blood meter starts out relatively small, it will gradually increase in size after consuming a victim's \"lore\" energy or by finding energy in special relics strewn about the world. Blocking during combat increases Kain's rage meter, which upon being filled, allows him to unleash any of his combat-related Dark Gifts: special powers regained at critical junctures in his journey. Charm, for example, allows Kain to possess weak-willed citizens and force them to do his bidding, while Mist makes him invisible when surrounded by fog, allowing Kain to sneak around undetected. As more of these Dark Gifts are acquired, areas previously unreachable become accessible. 400 years have passed since the vampire Kain damned the world in the original Blood Omen, choosing to rule the world in damnation then die for it?s salvation. Now Kain, who once controlled the land of Nosgoth with his vampire armies, finds his brethren slain and his dark powers stripped by a mysterious figure. To reclaim his rule and exact his vengeance, Kain must dispatch armies of zealot soldiers and overcome legions of demons in order to uncover the ominous plot that threatens the land he seeks to conquer."

The content focuses on the titular event in Fallout '​s alternate history. During the Great War, the United States Army liberated Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese forces. The pack contains several new quests, new items, and adds four new achievements. Gameplay within the simulation is different than the main game; health and ammo are replenished by stations in certain areas of the simulation world, items functionally do not suffer from decay, and enemy corpses disappear instead of allowing the player to loot them for supplies. Operation: Anchorage was released in North America and Europe on January 27, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live.[8][9] Although the content was scheduled for release on the PlayStation 3 in June 2009, the final week of June's PlayStation Store updates did not include it. Bethesda released information suggesting that the delay was due to their desire to iron out all of the bugs before release as well as test compatibility between DLCs.[10] Operation: Anchorage, along with The Pitt, were released on October 1, 2009, for PS3.[11] The Pitt[edit]\r\nThe Pitt is the second downloadable content pack. It allows the player to journey to the industrial raider town known as The Pitt, in the remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The pack features several new weapons, new armor and clothing items, four achievements and around four to five hours of gameplay. The Pitt was released on March 24, 2009 on Xbox Live and Games for Windows Live, but was quickly removed due to glitches in the gameplay which made the Xbox 360 version of the expansion unplayable. Further investigation was performed by Bethesda and Microsoft, and on March 25, 2009,[19] the expansion was again uploaded to Xbox Live, and was made available again that afternoon. For those who downloaded it on March 24 in the morning, glitches were still apparent. A new version was available on Xbox Live on April 2, fixing freezing issues many players had encountered with the previous version.[20] A retail disk was released at the end of May 2009[21] containing this and the Operation: Anchorage downloadable content. It was released for Xbox 360 and Games for Windows. The downloadable content is copied to the hard drive and function as it would had it been downloaded. This pack was released for the PlayStation 3 at the same time as Operation Anchorage on October 1, 2009."

The whole game takes place in \"flashbacks\", where 47 is reminiscing about past missions, some of which were previously seen in Hitman: Codename 47, the first game from the Hitman series. Gameplay in Hitman: Contracts is similar to the previous installments. Your job will be to complete several missions which involve assassinating targets all over the world. You can sneak around in disguise to avoid the suspicious guards, or you can instead open fire on everyone you see. When you complete your mission, you're given a rating - from \"Mass Murderer\" up to the coveted \"Silent Assassin\". If you manage to complete a mission with a \"Silent Assassin\" rating, you receive a reward: a special weapon (such as dual sawed-off shotguns), and you can try playing a previously completed mission using one of the special weapons."

There is however, a core quest, centering around rescuing the protagonist's sister, who is being held for ransom by mysterious forces who are scheming to open the tomb of Aziraal, the god of fire. The game does not utilize fixed character classes like other role-playing games. As the character gains experience and levels, it is possible to invest gained Attribute Points into any attribute, leading to a variety of game play styles and approaches. The world in which the game takes place is called Antaloor. While traveling through the game the player will encounter new teleports, caves, villages, and other locations, and these travels are recorded by the in-game mini-map. Teleports allow rapid travel between explored regions. Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures, though a number of commentators have lamented the clumsy controls when mounted. Death in the game leads to resurrection at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity.\r\nThere are various creatures in Two Worlds. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn, although most areas are densely populated. Beyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of his/her liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or devilishly evil and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests.

With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence. However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear. August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit's modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions. August 24. A lone soldier swoops down from out of the blue. The man's code name is Naked Snake."

        "daljsi_opis": "Because Capcom's Resident Evil single-handedly created the modern survival horror genre, the critically acclaimed adventure spawned countless sequels and clones. Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors. As a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities. Armed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline. In Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors. Features: * Rescue guests and turn them back into humans using an Anesthetic gun and white water\r\n* Take down enemies with a variety of weapons including pistols, shot guns, grenade launchers, and the Stun Glove\r\n* Help navigate Keith J. Snyder through a deserted and deadly casino in Plata Losa"

Facing the warriors are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.

Also included are more stage fatalities and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.

There is only one way left to defeat him once again - by wielding the magical Mavin Sword, forged from two metals bearing the property of the opposite forces, good and evil. The Oracles of Ishad N'Ha have charged a group of adventurers with the task of finding the sword and putting an end to Lord Cet. Wizards & Warriors is a traditional role-playing game similar in many ways to Wizardry series. In the beginning the player creates a party of up to six characters, choosing between ten races and four initial classes. The races include, besides traditional fantasy humanoids, animal-like creatures such as the boar-like Gourk or the Omphaaz, which resemble elephants. Each race is available in both genders and comes with bonuses and penalties to base attributes, as well as unique traits, such as improved treasure-hunting for Ratlings or night vision for the feline Whiskahs. The four initial classes (Warrior, Rogue, Priest, and Wizard) can be promoted to eight elite classes and three special ones, which include such rare professions as Valkyrie and Zenmaster, and require completion of specific tasks. The party starts in one of the few available towns, with still pictures representing locations (town hall, inn, armory, etc.), and navigation limited to clicking on them. However, the rest of the exploration (outdoors and in dungeons) is done in full 3D, with free exploration and camera rotation. Dungeons are connected by roads, forest paths, and other areas, and the player is usually able to explore freely, though access to certain locations may be restricted. Enemies can be found on set spots or appear randomly; the frequency of their appearance, as well as the overall difficulty, can be regulated in the main menu. Combat is real-time from the distance, but becomes turn-based when standing near the enemy. Magic comes in six schools: Spirit, Sun, Moon, Vine, Stone, and Fiend, with seven levels of spells each, and several spells per level. Casting spells drains the mage's mana pool. Characters can only cast spells within their own schools, with intensity of magic depending on his skill level, and limited by the amount of spell points in the school. Characters may join various guilds available in the game and thus gain access to special quests and promotions, take jobs, and perform other side quests."

The eight Shrines of Virtues, the pride of Britannia, have been all desecrated by this evil and mysterious creature. The glyphs which protected them have been taken, and put into huge columns the Guardian built in Britannia, with their entrances hidden deep in dangerous dungeons. As a result, the people of Britannia have lost their virtues. The Avatar must now cleanse the shrines and let the virtues return to the people. His task becomes particularly difficult because he cannot trust the people he encounters any more. With the help of a few allies, the Avatar will have to help the inhabitants of Britannia, and learn about the true origin of the Guardian. Ultima IX: Ascension is the last single-player installment of the Ultima series, and the conclusion of its overarching story. The game still contains role-playing elements such as the series' traditional character creation based on ethically ambiguous questions, a quest-based structure (including side quests), a large world to explore, heavy inventory management, financial system, as well as weapon and armor customization. However, the game has no experience points system; the protagonist's basic attributes are increased only after completing certain storyline events. Similarly to the previous installment, the combat in the game is action-oriented, and the protagonist has no companions that would help him in battles. The Avatar can use melee and ranged weapons (bows) or magic spells to dispose of his foes. The puzzle-oriented structure of the dungeons further emphasizes the game's tendency towards action-adventure gameplay not dissimilar to Zelda games. The game features support for EAX sound and a fully 3D world with an almost unrestricted freedom of movement: in addition to climbing and jumping, which the Avatar has \"learned\" in the previous game, he can also swim and dive; some well-hidden locations can only be accessed in this way. The physical interactivity with the game world has been preserved; almost every object can be moved from place to place or taken into the Avatar's inventory."

        "daljsi_opis": "As they have defeated all their rivals in Stilwater in the end of Saints Row 2, the Saints turned their street gang into a media empire soon after merging with the Ultor Corporation. They have since became an icon and own their own energy drink, a large fan base, and a movie deal in motion. However, when a fellow actor, Josh Birk, attempts to \"research\" his role for the Saints movie, they rob a bank and get caught. An international crime organization, called the Syndicate, bribes the police and gets the Saints' leader, Gat, and Shaundi released. They are then taken to the Syndicate's leader, Phillipe Loren, to try to negotiate business. While in flight, Loren tells them that they will be allowed to live if they give up two thirds of the Saints' revenue made in Stilwater. The gang leader rejects his offer, which leads to a gunfight. The leader and Shaundi escapes from the jet, while Gat attempts to hold back the enemies, and is presumably killed. To get revenge on the Syndicate, the Saints relocate to Steelport, a city that was once known for its flourishing factories, but has been recently suffering from economic failure. The Syndicate has already taken over Steelport, and controls it through three gangs: The Morningstar, led by he DeWynter sisters and Loren personally, the Luchadores, controlled by the Mexican wrestler Killbane, and The Deckers, led by Matt Miller, and his group of computer geniuses who deal with money laundering and oversee the Syndicate's security. The Saints now need to take control over the city, fighting other gangs and trying to reclaim their former glory. Saints Row: The Third is the third main game in the sandbox shooting and driving series. Like its predecessors, it focuses on third-person action, free-roaming driving, and urban warfare. The protagonist, leader of the Third Street Saints, explores the city of Steelport, performs missions that advance the game's story, as well as side missions. These include Activities, initiated at random points in the game world; Strongholds, rival gang bases that can be taken over to control sections of Steelport; and Flashpoints, actual gang warfare. Completing missions earns the player money, weapons, cars, and gang reputation. Past Saints Row games used reputation to unlock new missions; The Third uses reputation as experience points, which can be used to upgrade weapons and cars with various features, such as adding scopes or extra barrels to guns. Money can be used to customize the appearance, outfits, and headquarters of the gang. There is also an Initiation Station system which lets the player upload their characters created to an online community, and even download other players' characters to play with their save game. Lastly, money can also be used to buy shops and other properties in Steelport, which will, over time, become a stream of money for the gang. Some of the missions can be approached in different ways, and a few require the player to make choices. Novelty weapons are introduced along with the traditional arsenal of handguns and automatic weapons. Players can call down airstrikes on camps of enemies, or use a remote control electric bug to control vehicles from a range. Unlike the first two games, there are no health recovery items; instead, health regenerates at a faster rate out of combat. Just about every action in the game can be sped up by holding down a special button; for example, when stealing a car, it will cause the player character to missile-kick the driver out of the seat. The game also has a co-op mode; similarly to Saints Row 2, the second player participates in all missions and activities, receiving credit for their completion. Some activities have different rules when having two players. Co-op features require a single-use online pass. There is no competitive multiplayer mode in the game."

You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map. Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too). The missions range from simple sabotage to rescue."

Playboy: The Mansion is a social strategy game that calls on players to build a virtual empire of wealth, celebrity, and freedom from puritanical repression and intolerance. This is accomplished by developing a fully functioning Playboy mansion, to attract and accommodate influential celebrities and beautiful young models who are willing to strike the right poses. Players who can build a suitably entertaining and well-equipped mansion, while adhering to \"the Playboy philosophy,\" are rewarded with \"the Playboy lifestyle,\" surrounded by powerful trendsetters, influential pop idols, and sexually liberated young women. In short, the game invites players to take the role of a virtual Hugh Hefner.  As Hef, players will be responsible for keeping the Playboy brand relevant to its ever-evolving audience. One good way to do this is by attracting celebrity friends to the mansion, and making sure they have a good time when they visit. With enough money, players can build new facilities -- like swimming pools, movie theaters, or tennis courts -- which may have special appeal to particular celebrities. It's also a good idea to introduce these V.I.P. guests to Playmates who share their interests. The game's main interface should be familiar to Sims 2 players; characters are directed through their 3D domestic environments with mouse clicks, and clicked objects offer pop-up menus of available interactions. Coaxing powerful celebrity friends to appear in an issue of Playboy magazine can boost circulation, bringing in more income for future developments. As Hef, players can determine the content of each issue, choosing the articles, essays, cover shots, and centerfolds. They'll also have an opportunity to direct the photo shoots, choosing the location on the mansion grounds, the model, and the wardrobe selection -- all of which feature a \"topless\" option. The game includes a structured campaign that follows Hefner's real-life rise to international celebrity through a series of individual scenarios that focus on building the fame, circulation, and clout it took to develop the Playboy brand into what it is today. Players design their own challenges in the \"Empire\" mode, where they can set their own goals and victory conditions."

Initially armed with little more than a basic handgun, Meg will eventually amass weapons such as a shotgun, an assault rifle, a rocket launcher, and more. When in the virtual world, players can make use of a flashlight to help Meg find her way through the darkened corridors. Other useful items she include healing serum and various context-sensitive objects that will aid her progress through the adventure. Often, Meg will be required to seek out a specific character in order to advance. Cut scenes highlight important encounters throughout the quest.

The king ordered his men to slay the entire family of his loyal knight, Romulus, after Romulus questions the loyalty of the queen. You play as one of three characters; the Knight Romulus, his younger brother Remus, or Sylvia, Remus' bride and daughter to the king. As the three lay dying, they make a pact with an evil force, and return infused with unholy power, bent on revenge. As they make their way to the king, players must convert foes into zombie slaves. These zombies may be ordered to attack or pin down your opponents, break down barrier/objects, and even form unliving bridges to circumvent obstacles. Zombie minions may also be utilized as inhuman shields, objects to be thrown, and more. The game features a metal soundtrack, third person viewpoint, and gameplay similar to that of Tecmo's 3D Ninja Gaiden games. Players will collect \"Dark Energy\" along the way, which can be spent on character upgrades. In addition to the single player story mode, Undead Knights has ad-hoc multiplayer support for up to four players."

        "daljsi_opis": "Left 4 Dead is a cooperative first-person shooter video game with survival horror elements, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and published by Valve Corporation. The game uses Valve's proprietary Source engine, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. Development on the game was completed on November 13, 2008, and two versions were released digitally: A downloadable digital version, released on November 17, 2008, and a digital retail disc version, with a release date determined by region. The digital retail disc version was released in North America and Australia on November 18, 2008; and in Europe and Japan on November 21, 2008. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonists—dubbed the \"Survivors\"—against hordes of the infected. There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI; a four-player, co-op campaign mode; an eight-player online versus mode; and a four-player survival mode. In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the \"Director\", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value. Left 4 Dead was well received by the industry media upon its release, with praise given for its replay value, focus on cooperative play, and movie-like experience. Several criticisms were aimed at limited level selection and the lack of a narrative. The game has won several publication awards, as well as distinctions from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As was done with Team Fortress 2, Valve supplemented the game with free downloadable content. The first, called the \"Survival Pack\", was released on April 21, 2009. The second piece of DLC was charged for on Xbox Live and came in the form of a new Campaign entitled \"Crash Course,\" released for both the PC and Xbox 360 on September 29, 2009. The popularity of the game led to the development of a sequel, Left 4 Dead 2, which was released November 17, 2009. Left 4 Dead 2 was released on Mac OS X via Steam on October 5, 2010, and the original Left 4 Dead was released for the Mac soon after on October 28, 2010. The Mac version of Left 4 Dead 2 incorporated a new map for both Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, called \"The Sacrifice\". Eventually all Left 4 Dead campaigns were ported over to Left 4 Dead 2 and allowing for cross-platform support between Windows and Mac versions."

Players take the role of Laurence \"Prophet\" Barnes, a character featured in the previous two games but now for the first time as the protagonist. Set 24 years after the events of Crysis 2, it takes place in 2047. Once again the main character is equipped with a nanosuit that provides formidable abilities. Prophet returns as his personality and memories that were stored in the nanosuit are assimilated with the body of Alcatraz, the protagonist of the previous game, replacing his consciousness. What is left of Manhattan has been placed under a large dome by the CELL network to protect what is left of the alien civilization. Together with a team of elite soldiers, including his former teammate Psycho, Prophet travels to different locations to track down the Alpha Ceph, the leader of the Ceph race, and it plays out over seven chapters. Some story elements are explained by collecting audio diaries throughout the game. The setting mixes urban environments with lush, jungle-like growth. The bow is introduced as one of the prominent weapons. It is used for one-hit kills and can still be fired while Prophet is cloaked. There are different types of arrows to choose from. That way, stealth and sneaking optionally plays a larger role than in the previous games. Enemies consists of both humans and aliens, and of course regular weapons can still be used. They range from assault rifles and grenades to exotic types and there is also melee combat. The player can determine the nanosuit's configuration, focusing for instance on cloak or rather a strong armor with the capacity to take a lot of damage, or a speed mode to run fast and jump high. Configurations can be switched on the fly to adapt to situations quickly. By completing primary and secondary objectives, upgrade points can be gathered to extend the nanosuit abilities. Weapons can also be customized with various enhancements influencing weapon statistics such as accuracy, rate of fire, mobility, damage, range and stability. A tactical visor is used to scout the environment and to locate weapons and ammo. It can also be used to detect heat and tag enemies. The game also includes a hacking mini-game. Multiplayer game modes include (maximum) deathmatch, (maximum) team deathmatch, crash site / spears, extraction / capture the relay, hunter, assault, medley, CELL vs Rebel, and developer's choice. The nanonsuit is used extensively in multiplayer with all its abilities and in some game modes the focus is entirely on the bow as the primary weapon. Multiplayer contains an experience that, like many contemporary titles, provide various types of unlocks for weapons and abilities as the character levels up. Even though multiplayer contains cloak, there is still a vague outline visible. In addition, teammates and enemies are color coded in blue and red respectively."

        "daljsi_opis": "Amy is a survival horror game where the player controls the woman Lana as she attempts to escort the 8-year old autistic girl Amy out of a city overrun with creatures and military. At the start of the game they are together in a train as Lana escorts her to a hospital after she is busted out of a shady research facility. The train suddenly derails and they end up in a dark and hostile environment. The game is played from a third-person perspective and the main goal is to make sure Lana keeps Amy out of harm's way. The creatures send out an infection, but Amy has an immunizing aura that prevents Lana from being infected as long as she keeps close. Therefore she walks around holding the girl's hand most of the game and they often need to sneak past hazards together. Lana is however also able to take out enemies with melee combat mechanics using sticks and crowbars, but in many situations that is not an option due to the number of opponents. Weapons also degrade over time. When Lana lets go of Amy, the infection gradually sets in and it causes the contamination sensor on her back to turn from green to yellow and red. It turns her skin pale and renders her vision hazy, but at certain points in the game it is necessary to sneak past creatures who then think she is one of their own. As Amy's survival is vital for Lana, in many locations she is able to make her hide in closets or other spots when danger is lurking. The options to hide appear automatically when a viable location is nearby. Lana can also hide together with the girl or just by herself. All other control over Amy is also indirect. Lana can ask her to stay in a fixed place, call her to come over, make her turn on a lamp, or ask her to interact with an object in the environment. Amy has to hack into computers, crawl through small grates to access rooms, stand on elevators, and push buttons. There are also locks that can only be opened by collecting a specific DNA sample. These interactions are used extensively for environment-based puzzles. Later in the game Amy gets access to two psychic powers she can call upon; sending out a bubble that knocks down an opponent and a field that silences everything inside. These are activated by having Amy draw a glyph at specific locations around levels. The game consists of six chapters and saving is done automatically through checkpoints."

The game follows John Marston as he searches for a cure for an infectious zombie plague that has swept across the American Old West. Undead Nightmare is played from a third-person perspective in an open world environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the Western United States and Mexico, primarily by horseback and on foot. Hordes of zombies traverse the world, often attacking towns. Gunfights emphasize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic called \"Dead Eye\" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. Two gameplay modes were added to Red Dead Redemption‍ '​s online multiplayer mode upon release of Undead Nightmare, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting. Upon its release, Undead Nightmare received generally positive reviews. It won year-end accolades, including Best DLC awards from several gaming publications. A Game of the Year Edition, bundling the game with Red Dead Redemption and all additional content, was released in October 2011."

Ever since she was a child, she has shared a bond with an entity she calls Aiden. That entity isn't controlled by her, but the two of them cannot go separate ways. This ability, and this bond they share have made her feel like a lab rat all her life. Eventually, she was even recruited and trained by the CIA because of her special gift. But what will happen when she decides she no longer wants to be anyone's puppet and decides to break off and go her own way... will she be let to do so, or will she be hunted down... Much like Heavy Rain, the player has a multitude of choices during the game which may in minor or major way affect the overall story with several different endings. During gameplay, player can switch between Jodie and Aiden at any time. While controlling Jodie, player can explore the surroundings, interact with objects, talk to other characters or fight if in such a situation. While controlling Aiden, the player can float around up to a limited distance from Jodie, and sometimes move or trash certain objects. As the story progresses, Aiden will be able to possess or even kill certain characters."

The game is divided into 12 episodes in locations all over the world and stars Mondo Zappa as the main character. He is a contract executioner who works for the he Bryan Execution Firm. The game is set in the future and Mondo receives jobs to kill cyborgs and assassins. Before each mission a brief overview of the objective is shown against a world map and in between the fighting there are often animated sequences that further the story. Completing a main mission usually opens up several side missions. The main character wields a katana called Gekkou with his right hand for attacks and to deflect bullets. It absorbs bloods filling up a meter, enhancing Mondo's fighting ability. Combos increase the attack speed and a moon slash can be performed as a powerful attack. His left arm has a cybernetic enhancement and it is called Musselback. Various operations can be performed with it and these require blood absorbed from enemies. It is also used to solve puzzles and discover hidden areas, with four functions for the arm in total. Mondo can turn it into a regular human hand to crack fingerprint codes or change it into a ranged sub weapon that shoots projectiles. Separate buttons are used to block and dodge. Defeated enemies leave behind body parts that recover health and blood. Yellow moon crystals are collected to upgrade skills and health gems can level up the maximum health level. After each mission Mondo receives a payment based on his performance. It is based on statistics such as his completion score, total damage bonus, rescue payment and toughness payment, total cool kills bonus, execution time or guard break payment, along with a general rating. Upgrades through moon crystals are divided into three categories: attack skills, sub weapon skills and special skills, unlocked gradually and with a fixed progression for each type. In the main office different types of costumes for various characters can be equipped (when unlocked) and there is a gift shop where cash can be spent on various items. One of these are Mika tickets, that have his assistant Mika come to rescue when Mondo dies, providing a way to continue."

In this game, players stray away from the protagonists in the first two games, Salem and Rios, and play as two different Tactical Worldwide Operations (T.W.O.) operatives, Alpha and Bravo. Alpha and Bravo are hired by a Mexican Mayor by the name of Cordova, who hires the two to take down the ruthless drug cartel La Guadana and its leader, Estaban Bautista. The game, as with its predecessors, revolves around its co-op play. There is now less focus on two-player interactions to approach situations and more on regular shootouts. In addition to its already established cooperative base, this installment adds much more customization. Masks, gear, and weapons are all now customizable to tailor to the preferences of the player. The new destructible environment also adds a new aspect to the game, where players can destroy and manipulate the environment around them to their own advantage. The scoring system is based on the kills and rewarded with cash, which also acts as experience. Based on the chosen approach different rewards can be earned. Killing enemies also fills an Overkill gauge. Once full, a mode can be activated where the character for a short time becomes invulnerable with unlimited ammo, slowed down time and more damage. Overkill can be applied to a single character or to both."

        "daljsi_opis": "Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034, the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length. Initially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012; it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver. Metro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues. Just like the original game Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played from the perspective of Artyom, the player-character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring the player above ground. As a first-person shooter, Metro: Last Light features a variety of firearms, some fictional and some based on real weapons, which the player will use in combat. Combat alternates between the player fighting mutants and the player fighting hostile humans. Mutants do not possess weapons and tend to physically attack the player in swarms, while humans fight with the same firearms available to the player. The game features recharging health rather than a traditional health points system—if the player avoids taking damage for a period, health will slowly recharge. The player can speed up this process by using a stim from a medkit, which will almost instantly heal the player to full health. When the player is severely injured, it may take over twenty seconds to return to full health. Health does not regenerate on, or above the \"Hardcore\" difficulty. In the post-apocalyptic environment, ammunition is a rare and essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse military-grade ammunition is used as currency; to avoid \"shooting money\", the player can also use lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and items. The military-grade ammo can be used to purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. The game's locations reflect the dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and noises are frequent, and, for the most part, the player has to rely on their rechargeable flashlight (and sometimes, a pair of night-vision goggles) to find the way around in otherwise total darkness. Even more lethal is the surface, as it is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air. Often, locations have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map, leaving the player to try to find their objectives with only a compass. As Metro: Last Light aims to be immersive, the gameplay and interface are somewhat atypical. The game lacks a health meter, relying on audible heart rate and blood spatters on the screen to show the player's current state of health. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask, which last several minutes each and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. There is no heads-up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail—rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The gas mask can become visibly damaged and will stop functioning if punctured, requiring it to be replaced. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammo and they have to reload. The game does feature sparse traditional HUD elements, such as an ammunition indicator. However, on the hardest difficulty setting, no HUD elements are present, and players have to keep track of ammunition by the partly visible magazines. There are also certain moral choices in the game that give Karma. Good Karma can be acquired by good actions, such as rescuing people from the enemy characters. Bad Karma can be acquired from evil actions, such as killing people randomly or stealing things."

Anointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat. Since the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them. A behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live."

It consists of a series of sequences from the three movies in chronological order, preceded by a flashback tutorial level set in Vietnam. The gameplay is based around the rail shooter concept and does not offer freedom of movement. Instead the camera guides the player through the levels while the player moves the cross-hair in a first-person view to take out enemies. These are often combined with non-lethal takedowns using quick time events. In those sections the player is encouraged to shoot hands and legs to disarm opponents instead of killing them directly. Sometimes the two gameplay concepts are combined in stealth sections. Lots of enemies need to be killed and the player is rewarded with a multiplier for linking kills. Sometimes an enemy has an exclamation mark over the head and needs to be killed quickly, or his shot is lethal. Other gameplay elements include a cover system through arrows on the screen, active reload for double ammunition, and a kill cam for precise shots. While fighting Rambo builds up a wrath meter. Once activated, time slows down, there is unlimited ammo, and enemies glow orange and provide health when killed. By killing people and completing sections experience is earned to assign skill points and unlock perks. Up to three can be assigned simultaneously. Next to the main mission goals there are optional challenges provided by Colonel Trautman. Completing these opens up the ability to determine which weapons to take into a level. Rambo fights with a knife, guns and grenades. The game offers two-player local cooperative multiplayer games."

        "daljsi_opis": "Resident Evil 4, known as Biohazard 4 (バイオハザード4 Baiohazādo Fō?) in Japan, is a survival horror third-person shooter video game developed and published by Capcom. The sixth main entry in the Resident Evil horror series, the game was originally released for the GameCube in North America and Japan in January 2005, and in Europe and Australia in March 2005. The story of Resident Evil 4 follows the U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the U.S. President's daughter who has been kidnapped by a sinister cult. Traveling to a remote rural area of Europe, Leon fights hordes of violent villagers and mutated monsters, and reunites with the mysterious spy Ada Wong. The game pioneered and popularized the \"over the shoulder\" third-person view perspective in video games. First hinted at in early December 1999, Resident Evil 4 underwent a long development time during which four proposed versions of the game were discarded. Initially developed for the Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2, the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami requested him to create a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Nevertheless, it was decided to start development over again. The game was intended to be a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but a PlayStation 2 version was announced before the game was released for the GameCube. Resident Evil 4 was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows, Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and in heavily condensed versions for the iOS phones and Zeebo. In April 2013, Resident Evil 4 was launched on Android but only for Samsung smartphones via Galaxy Apps and earlier in 2013 it was available for the Japanese Google Play.[1] Resident Evil 4 garnered universal critical acclaim. It received many Game of the Year awards for 2005, and was seen as a successful cross-platform hit that highly influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person shooter genres. It has since been listed among the best video games of all time."

The game is played from a 2.5D perspective, with players being able to move horizontally and vertically. The game has several new features over its predecessor such as non-linear levels, stealth-based combat, attack combos and usable equipment such as gas masks and night vision goggles. Associate Producer James Wong stated in an interview that the original game was \"wave after wave of enemies\" and that the development team sought to \"go a little deeper\" while retaining the \"pick up and play nature of the original game.\" The game spans three large levels that are traversed both horizontally and vertically. The player character is initially armed only with a knife, but can pick up other temporary-use weaponry such as grenades, rifles and rocket launchers. The game sometimes requires the player character to use stealth to avoid enemy units or security cameras. Triggering any alarm will result in nearby enemies rushing to the source of the alarm trigger. Alarms can by triggered by making too much noise or by being noticed by one of the security cameras within the game's setting. In a departure from Rush'n Attack, the player character is given a health bar instead of the original one hit death. shank combos are the primary way in which players can earn points.The combat system is based on systema, a Russian martial art. As the character progresses new combos can be unlocked. Chaining combos together will result in the player gaining more points earned. The character can also dispatch enemies using stealth tactics. Generally stealth kills reward the player with a higher score. Stealth kills can be performed by hiding in dark areas or by entering dark doorways, then exiting for the kill as an enemy passes."

Equipment and character classes also differ depending on era. Each side has set character classes, so most players need to be content with playing a normal soldier. Red Orchestra has been designed to be as real as possible. There are no aiming markers; the players have to use the iron sights. There are also no markers to identify friend from foe: the only way to tell is to look at their uniforms. There are also no ammo meters. The realism goes so far that the player actually has to pull out the empty cartridge after firing a bolt-action rifle. Even suppressive fire is useful as bullets going near make shooting more difficult. There is a total of 28 infantry weapons and 14 different vehicles, each realistically modeled."

After meeting some other characters, the ship is overrun and after it crashes down the four land on the island Palanai, which is also affected by the infection. As the four survivors struggle to get off the island, they also become involved with finding out the cause of the outbreak through Frank Serpo, the local researcher, Dr. Kessler, and the WHO researcher, Harlow. Players can choose any of the four survivors, each with their own abilities (even starting with a save game of the character from the previous title), or control the new character, John Morgan, who is also immune. He has a powerful kick attack that is very useful in close combat situations. The gameplay is largely identical as the survivor roams the surroundings, defeats enemies and gathers tools and weapons that can be customized and upgraded. The tropical setting is retained, but the surroundings are diversified through towns, cities and jungle. Water also plays an important role now, with large areas and cities that are flooded and many parts that can be traveled by boat. Characters can still move by foot or use a vehicle. Next to the regular quests that mainly require the character to fetch items, there are hub defense missions where a certain area needs to be barricaded and defended for a set amount of time. The game offers new weapons and customization options, as well as new enemies. Unlike in the first game, firearms are available almost right away. Thus, the player has the choice to play it as a first-person shooter rather than a brawler like the first game emphasized on."

A director's cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is similar to a series of murders across the United States. The Director's Cut was released roughly three years after the original version, and is more of an enhanced version than a remake. The main three updates in comparison to the original game are: • Graphics - enhanced with redrawn textures, new lighting and shading and 3D support\r\n• Controls - updated and with PlayStation Move support\r\n• Story - extended with additional scenarios"

Next to the regular battles, you can play a free-roaming adventure in the Konquest Mode, battle an endless wave of opponents in the Endurance Mode (exclusive for the PSP), go head-to-head over Wi-Fi against another human player, or try a mini-game such as Chess Kombat (chess with the MK characters) and Puzzle Kombat (Tetris with a twist)."

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life. Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable. As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill. The Wii Remote controls a flashlight aimed in real-time. Harry's cell phone accepts calls and messages from both the real and the supernatural, and a camera function is used to uncover hidden ghosts and their messages."

Agrippa can use special moves such as \"Red Volcano\" - a move used to slice enemies in half - to please the crowds. As a result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa. Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the player will have to find a new one inside the area. In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and impersonating someone."

In December 2006, a portable version was released on the PlayStation Portable (under the title Blitz: Overtime). These versions included the voicework and likeness of former pro linebacker Bill Romanowski. The game was originally intended to be a Wii launch title, but the Wii-version was delayed[1] and eventually canceled.[2] On January 22, 2007, the game was refused classification[3] by the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia, effectively banning the game there.

It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Skyrim was released worldwide on November 11, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released—Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn—which were repackaged into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition, which was released on June 4, 2013. Skyrim '​s main story revolves around the player character and their effort to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. The game was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse game world than Oblivion '​s Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Skyrim was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly mentioning the refined character development and the great setting, and is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and sold over 20 million copies across all three platforms."

The game can be played in six game modes: Attrition (team deathmatch with hostage rescuers against kidnappers), Capture the Flag, Hardpoint (capture and hold three locations), Last Titan Standing (last player alive wins, all players start in a Titan), Pilot Hunter (score for the team by killing pilots, not Titans - at the end of the match there is an epilogue where respawns are disabled and the losing team needs to reach an evacuation point/dropship for additional experience points), and Variety Pack (mix of all game modes). There is also a Campaign mode for each faction with a mix of different game modes and bits of story between each mission. The game is fast-paced and while on foot pilots are able to wall jump and link jumps in a parkour style using a jet-boosted belt. In a general game players start by choosing a pilot type. Some of the available weapons include assault rifles, SMGs, shotguns, sniper rifles and smart pistols. During the match a timer counts down (generally three minutes) until a Titan can be deployed. The timer countdown can be shortened by killing other players. When a Titan drops down from the sky a pilot can board it. Playing as a Titan has completely different movement, but it is still agile. The pilot's double jump is for instance replaced by a dash as a Titan cannot jump, crouch or seek cover. A Titan has very different weapons and is much stronger to take on other Titans. It can be ejected at any time when under attack and it is possible to issue commands to have it follow or guard you. Other players can attempt to board and throw out a player. These can be repelled by activating electric smoke and a Titan has also distinct abilities such as the vortex blocker to stop incoming projectiles, gather them and return them in midair. It is also possible to crush pilots. When a Titan is destroyed a new countdown timer is started. Other game elements include burn cards (up to three per match) for temporary power-ups and AI-controlled minions with three types: grunts, marvins and spectres. The game has a persistent experience system and pilots can level up. This influences for instance the loadouts for both pilots and Titans prior to each match. The available slots for pilots offer room a primary weapon with mod and/or attachment, an anti-Titan weapon, sidearm, tactical ability (for instance cloak, stim or active radar pulse) and kits with specific abilities for different tiers. For a Titan the loadout consists of the chassis, primary weapon with mod, tactical ability, ordinance weapon and different kits."

The sixth installment of the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series, it is the sequel of Splinter Cell: Conviction. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Xbox 360 in August 2013. Players control Sam Fisher, a spymaster working for the Fourth Echelon, in a mission to stop the Engineers, a group of terrorists which is trying to coerce the United States into recalling all of its troops stationed abroad. Blacklist '​s gameplay is similar to its predecessors, with players tasked with completing objectives and defeating enemies. The game endeavors to combine elements of its predecessors, including the action focus of Conviction and the stealth focus of the older games. Blacklist marks the return of the asymmetrical multiplayer mode Spies vs. Mercs, which was introduced in Pandora Tomorrow. It is the first title developed by Ubisoft Toronto, a studio founded by Ubisoft in 2009. The game was directed by Maxime Béland, who had worked on Conviction. To prepare for this game, Béland studied reviews and feature lists of the latter. Blacklist is the first Splinter Cell game starring Eric Johnson as Sam Fisher, since series veteran Michael Ironside was unable to perform motion capture for the game. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and its later-announced Wii U version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai. Blacklist '​s pre-release reception was generally positive, despite criticism of its new voice actor. The game received generally-positive reviews when it was released, with praise for its level design, story, and multiplayer mode and criticism of dated graphics. It failed to meet Ubisoft's sales expectations, with sales of two million copies three months after its release."

Also when owning both games, they can be linked using a USB cable to open up the Infected mode. It provides an alternate history, mixing events of the two games. Grayson is recruited by Specter Lieutenant David LaSalle (from Resistance 2) and is infected with a mutated version of the Chimeran virus. In this game mode, Grayson wears a Specter uniform and has glowing Chimeran eyes. He can regenerate health, gets access to new weapons and breathes underwater. He is also able to reach hidden passages and pick up intel, unlocking plasma grenades and even a further expanded story. This game mode ends when the game is quit and progress cannot be saved. Multiplayer consists of battles through Ad Hoc and Infrastructure with statistics tracking on MyResistance.net.

The ability to take POWs, added enhanced stealth options for the player which include the acquisition of enemy uniforms. Mission types include, espionage, sabotage, search and destroy, town liberation, prisoner rescue, retrieval of enemy officers and documents, partisan assistance and assassination. The variety of locales include Norway, Libya, a Norwegian fjord, Burma, Austria, France and Czechoslovakia. The expansion pack Sabre Squadron adds missions in France, Libya and Sicily. Some of the missions are modeled on real SAS exploits. However most of the game takes liberty with the historical time and place of SAS operations. The missions are based on sandbox style game-play where players are free to roam a map and pursue objectives usually at their leisure and choice of sequence.

This is the sixth CSI game released, and the first for CSI: NY.\r\nAs with the previous CSI games, there are five cases to work on. However, the game has taken a drastic graphical change, opting for a stylised 2D cartoon look, instead of the rendered 3D graphics of previous games in the CSI franchise. The game will allow you to control a CSI (Mac or Stella) and solve cases, collect evidence and solve puzzles. You will also be able to interrogate suspects with branching dialogue options, and depending on your tone or line of questioning you may find the suspects refuse to co-operate, or tell you everything you need to know.\r\nThis is Legacy Interactive's first CSI game. They previously created the Law and Order videogames.\r\nAs of April 2009, UBISOFT released the final case (\"Derailed\"). This case requires game patch 1.01 (it can be installed if the PC has an active internet connection). Mac Taylor becomes the prime suspect on the case when his DNA is discovered all over the body of a dead man."

Originally released in August 2011 for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, it is the third game in the Deus Ex series, and a prequel to the original game released in 2000.[4] An OS X version, Deus Ex: Human Revolution Ultimate Edition, was released on April 26, 2012 by Feral Interactive; it includes the original game and The Missing Link downloadable content.[5][6] An improved version of the game for PC and consoles, including a Wii U version, was released on October 22, 2013 as Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut.[7] Feral Interactive released the OS X version of Director's Cut on April 15, 2014.[8] The Director's Cut includes The Missing Link as part of the main plot. Microsoft added the game to the list of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One on December 17, 2015. [9] The game is set in 2027, 25 years before the first game and 45 years before the second game, at a time when multinational corporations have grown in power beyond the control of national governments. The game follows Adam Jensen, the newly hired security manager at Sarif Industries, a growing biotechnology firm. After terrorists brutally attack Sarif's Detroit-based headquarters, the mortally wounded Jensen is forced to undergo radical life-saving surgeries that replace large areas of his body with advanced prostheses and internal organ systems. Returning to work, he becomes embroiled in the global politics of the human enhancement movement in the search for those responsible for the attack. Central themes to the game are the rise of corporations in globalization, espionage, human survival, poverty, and the ethics of advancing humans with artificial replacements for body parts. Human Revolution received critical acclaim upon its release, with many reviewers praising the open-ended nature of the game and the weight of social interaction on the outcome of events.[10] A sequel, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, was revealed in April 2015, which will be available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[11]"

Myra Lee is a stealth agent who uses various technical equipments to pass her enemies without being seen, most notably her invisibility suit and the crossbow with different ammo types. Besides the obvious killing function, special bolts can be used for other purposes such as distraction or to hide bodies. Of course Myra can sneak behind the enemy's back by using the cover system and neutralize them silently. Aron Alvez on the other hand prefers a more direct approach and shoots his opponents. Brute force however is no liable tactic because this game uses the traditional medi pack health system instead of automatic healing. Other reasons are the checkpoint saving system and accurate enemies. In most levels the player can instantly switch between those two characters, but sometimes the used character is enforced."

Deathmatch Classic also imitates Quake's physics, which allows an advanced player to gain a lot of extra speed or jump very high by using a number of movement skills such as bunny hopping and rocket jumping. The default game speed in Deathmatch Classic is somewhat slower than in Quake. The weapons scale from the basic shotgun to the rocket launcher and the \"shaft\", a powerful directed-energy weapon. Three kinds of bonuses are scattered over the maps, which give the player a temporary special power: \"quad damage\", \"invulnerability\", and the \"ring of shadows\" which turns the player into a ghostly, almost invisible figure."

Through a series of events Edward assumes the identity of a rogue member of the Assassins reporting to Laureano Torres, the Governor of Cuba and also the Grand Master of the Templars. Initially motivated by greed, Edward finds himself at odds with both the Templars and the Assassins, who are both pursuing a mysterious man known as the Sage in order to gain access to the secret technology of the First Civilization. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is the sixth major installment in the series. While it introduces a new historical protagonist, its modern-day story continues the overarching plot, particularly the arc that started in Assassin's Creed III. Most of the familiar elements from the previous installments return, including free-form movement, the possibility to climb on buildings, a mission-based system with main and secondary quests, weapon management, collecting, etc. Besides a few tweaks, combat system largely remains unchanged as well. The game's world is larger than in any of the previous games, and is available for exploration in a seamless fashion, without transitions or loading between ship navigation, swimming, and exploring the land. Much of the Caribbean Sea can be physically explored, including three full-fledged cities (Havana, Kingston, and Nassau) as well as smaller settlements and uninhabited islands. The protagonist can now hunt animals, fish, and uncover treasure maps. Early in the game Edward gains access to the Jackdaw, a ship that can be outfitted, upgraded, and used in naval battles. It is also possible to recruit crew members for the ship."

His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange dreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until one night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the story of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the only barrier between the world and darkness. The monk makes a proposition: Ryan becomes the \"deliverer\": the one who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it. Descending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan accepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next to his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work. Again. DreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic dystopian city. Each location takes only a small portion of the screen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the corner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with objects and people by simply clicking them. Ryan has a limited inventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many without any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful and what just serves as filler.  Dialogue is straightforward, with no options, but still required to advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance). In situations where many adventure games usually feature an indirect approach to solve a problem, Ryan often faces himself with situations where it's \"killed or be killed\", which result in deaths (sometimes of innocents). The game also contains a few scenes with graphically explicit sexual situations. The original release of the game included Diary Of a (Mad?) Man, a 40-page diary telling the descent of Ryan into madness, or his destiny, written by Stephen Marley, providing a complete background to the events leading to the start of the game."

The plot is set in feudal age Japan, and revolves around a group of ninjas and assassins who get involved into the kidnapping of Lord Gohda's single daughter, Princess Kiku. The game's protagonists are Rikkimaru and Ayame (both ninjas of the Azuma clan, working for Lord Gohda), Rin (a renegade ninja of the Beniya clan), and Tesshu (a medical doctor who works as a hired assassin at night). All four characters' campaigns can be selected right from the start. Each character's campaign encompasses eight missions. The gameplay is once again based on the stealth-action genre's fundamental premise of completing the mission goals with being discovered as few times as possible, since the player characters are hopelessly outnumbered by the enemy guards. When the player approaches an unsuspecting enemy from behind, he can perform a stealth kill, which kills the target instantly without risking a fight. Mission objectives vary from getting to a certain location on the map, taking out a certain target, to escorting NPCs to a designated area. A distance sensor indicates how great the distance is between the player and the closest enemy, but not the direction in which the enemy is. It also shows whether the enemy is aware of the players presence. As usual for the series, the player is free choose between several weapons and gadgets, which he obtains as reward for completing mission. The better the ranking he receives after the missions, the more and better items he receives. Gadgets include throwing knifes, poisonous rice, healing potions, smoke bombs, grenades and many more. Aside from these optional accessories the player always has a trusty grappling hook at his disposal, which can be used to climb houses and ledges. The game also features a mission editor to create story-driven single player missions, as well as multiplayer missions. The multiplayer mode can be played competitively and cooperatively with 2 players."

        "daljsi_opis": "Shadow of the Beast is a re-imagining of the 1989 game of the same name. It has the same premise as the original title and also draws inspiration from the art and design. The player controls the creature Aarbron in the alien landscape Karemoon. He was a human, kidnapped as a child, and transformed into a monstrous warrior beast as a servant. This is only revealed to him when an encounter killing humans triggers a flashback. He then seeks revenge against his master Zelek. The game uses side-scrolling gameplay as in the original game, but now as a 2.5D title with full 3D models and environments restricted to a single, horizontal plane of movement. During many scenes the camera often zooms out with different layers in the background and foreground. Levels are often split up in encounters where multiple enemies need to be defeated similar to brawlers. Claw-based melee attacks can be strung together into combos with a score multiplier and four different target scores, each with their own medal based on the performance. A single button is used to attack, along with a timing and distance element to land it in different ways based on specific animation frames. It is possible to block, dodge and parry. Enemies can also be stunned, grabbed and thrown and brutal finishers can be performed up close. Killed enemies leave behind blood that is collected to fill a meter in the bottom left corner with different bars. With a sufficient amount a Rage Chain and other attacks can be activated. These combat sections usually have enemies pouring in from the left and the right. Sometimes there are more than 20 at once meaning fighting also has a space management or rhythm element to keep attacking and fending off on both sides. Later enemies are impervious to attacks and have specific vulnerabilities. A special Wrath of Aarbron attack, using a limited, rare wrath currency can attack enemies on both sides at once as a final measure. That resource is earned by doing a different special attack that consumes bars of the the blood meter. There is also a health meter and some attacks can be performed at the cost of health. Players often need to decide when and where to deploy a maxed out blood meter. Unlike the original game exploration is more linear and straightforward with self-contained sections. Some jumping, climbing, wall running and sliding is required to clear obstacles, but the focus is on fighting with some environment based puzzle elements based on locating and breaking seals, flipping switches or exploring different paths. Each level ends with a boss fight where often different gameplay or new perspectives are introduced. The level score is converted into mana that can be spent in the Wisdom of Shadows. It provides access to combat upgrades affecting health and attacks with multiple upgrade levels. The scores of friends are displayed in leaderboards along with an in-game live feed for their accomplishments. It has a button-mashing mini-game with a race against time to dismember and decapitate a friend's beast. The game includes an emulated version of the original 1989 Amiga title as an unlockable extra with an unlimited lives mode to make it easier to play, as well as unlockable videos for additional lore, a bestiary, the soundtrack and a retrospective on the development of the entire trilogy. Levels have secret encounters and collectible orbs and talismans. The latter can be equipped for special abilities. It is also possible to buy forbidden tomes that translate parts of the alien language used in the game. Extended endings are available for the different difficulty levels."

One thousand years after his victory over the Lords of Shadow and Satan himself, at the cost of his own humanity, Dracula is visited by his old \"friend\" Zobek, bringing dire news. Satan is about to return, and only Dracula can stop him and his minions from destroying the world. If he succeeds, Zobek promises to free him from the curse of immortality. But before Dracula can take the fight to Satan's acolytes, he will have to recover his old powers. As its predecessor, Lords of Shadow 2 combines exploration of 3D environments (now with full control of the camera), melee combat and platforming sequences. Instead of a linear succession of levels, however, Lords of Shadow 2 offers a semi-open structure, more similar in spirit to Symphony of the Night. The game alternates between sequences set in modern-day Wygol City, as Dracula tries to undermine the efforts of Satan's acolytes, and dreamlike visits to Dracula's castle. The Prince of Darkness must explore the now-hostile fortress to locate his lost powers and other upgrades. New gameplay features include a new set of weapons and abilities for the protagonist, like the Void Sword capable of draining the enemies' health and the Chaos Claws used to break shields/armors and other destructible objects. Dracula can also use various vampire powers, such as drinking blood to restore his health or turning into a plague of rats during stealth sequences."

However, mysterious events led to the exile of King Vendrick, and the land became desolate, with lost souls dwelling in it. Meanwhile, a lone traveler is seen near the village of Majula. He is trying to find a cure for a terrible curse that has fallen upon him, forcing him to lose his humanity and prey upon the souls of the dark beings. An enigmatic woman known as the Emerald Herald tells him that the Four Grand Souls have to be collected in order to bring redemption to the traveler and the entire land of Drangleic. Dark Souls II is a sequel to Dark Souls, sharing its dark medieval fantasy setting, though it is set in a different land and is not directly connected to it story-wise. In terms of gameplay mechanics, the game is very similar to its predecessor, being a third-person action role-playing game with interconnected world exploration and a deliberate emphasis on challenge. Most cardinal aspects of the gameplay remain the same. Combat relies on timing, precision, as well as dodging and blocking moves that deplete stamina. Defeating enemies yields souls, which can be used at a special bonfire to level up, manually increasing the protagonist's main attributes. The game also features character creation that allows the player to customize the protagonist's class, genre, and physical appearance. The player character is cursed, and each death deprives him of his humanity, sending him back to the last bonfire he has visited. Unlike the previous game, leveling up can only occur at one specific bonfire in the game; however, the player can freely teleport between all the bonfires he has accessed. Another difference is the limitations imposed on respawning enemies - after several tries defeated enemies will no longer re-appear after resting at a bonfire. Magic is given more prominence, enemies having more pronounced strengths and weaknesses to various elements. Joining covenants and participating in special events such as dueling against each other and cooperative fighting are featured in the game's multiplayer mode."

The game is viewed from a top-down perspective and the character is controlled directly with the keyboard to move around and the mouse to shoot and slash at zombies and competing human players. In addition to the ordinary weapon attacks it is also possible to do a secondary attack which is powerful but consumes rage. Rage is generated by doing the primary attacks. The game consists of three game modes: starter missions, crossroads and scavenger. Starter missions are PvE missions for a single player meant to prepare the player for the scavenger and crossroads modes. Crossroads missions are PvE too but more challenging and made for four players who have to cooperate against AI opponents. The players have to answer calls from Dr. Bauer, the leader of their group of survivors, who send them out on missions to save civilians, grab supplies from vehicles and clear areas of zombies. The scavenger mode is PvP and involves three teams, each with four players, who have to collect vital supplies and hold key strategic points."

It is a spin-off of the Legacy of Kain series of action-adventure games, and takes place in their eponymous fictional universe. Nosgoth employs a player versus player system in which each match consists of two rounds. Teams comprise characters assigned to one of two races: vampires, designed around hack and slash combat; or humans, whose gameplay is styled after third-person shooters. Between rounds, teams switch to control the opposing race, and the team which accumulates the most points by fighting their counterparts wins the match. Initially announced in June 2013 following internet leaks, Nosgoth was the first Legacy of Kain-associated game to debut in almost ten years, preceded by 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Though once intended for release as part of a single-player project, Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun, it was reconceptualized and continued development as a standalone title following Dead Sun's cancellation. When officially revealed in September 2013, Nosgoth attracted negative reception; criticism focused on its conceptual departure from the traditional single-player and story-driven Legacy of Kain formula.[7][8][9] The game is currently in its closed beta phase."

The game begins in 1946 with Blazkowicz chasing down his arch-enemy General Wilhelm \"Deathshead\" Strasse knowing that if he can kill Deathshead the Nazi war machine will be crippled. His plans backfire however and Blazkowicz is mortally wounded and put into a partial coma. He is rescued by a Polish fishing vessel and taken to an asylum in Poland where 14 years pass as he is cared for by a nurse named Anya. When he finally awakens and saves Anya from the Nazi purge of the asylum, he soon learns that the war has ended and the Nazis won, thus placing the entire world under their rule. Deathshead was instrumental to this victory as he designed vicious bio-mechanical beasts and massive robots to gain superiority in the battlefield while also bombarding the United States with atomic bombs until their eventual surrender. Blazkowicz arms up once again and sets out to reignite the flames of rebellion by freeing his friends from the Kreisau Circle and toppling the Nazi regime! As with previous entries in the series the game is a fast-paced and violent first-person shooter with some minor stealth and exploration elements. Players can hold several weapons at a time and said weapons can even be dual wielded. The weapons range from traditional weapons such as knives, pistols, and shotguns but later in game there is more exotic gear such as electricity spewing grenades, lasers, bladed weapons etc. You are also given a useful tool called the Laser Cutter, which allows you to cut through chains, fences, etc. to access alternate paths and secret items and areas. Players fight plenty of Nazi soldiers of varying strength, some wearing power armour and some are even bio-mechanical and blend flesh with technology. There are also bio-mechanical German Shepherds that act as guard dogs and can sneak up on the player to attempt to tear out his throat. In addition there are bigger fully robotic dogs that are extremely fast, lithe, and dangerous. Players have the option of taking a stealthy route and killing enemies silently with silenced weapons and knives that can be used for brutal backstabbing takedowns or can be thrown at enemies in the distance. At times you will be notified of a Nazi officer in the area. Hunting him down and killing him quietly will reveal areas on the player's map. The game features a perk tree, which will level up based on certain challenges in the game such as killing 10 enemies silently with throwing knives to earn extra knife slots or killing several enemies while your health is overcharged (above 100%) to gain a perk where killing enemies grants small health boosts. These perks come in different categories (assault, demolition, stealth and tactical) and are based around the player's chosen play style. Also in line with previous games in the series, there are secrets to be collected. These include items that can give you a full map of the area, notes and letters that provide backstory, Enigma Codes which unlock special game modes, and Nazi gold and treasure."

        "daljsi_opis": "Mortal Kombat X is a fighting game in which two players fight against each other using a variety of attacks, special moves, and gruesome Fatalities. The energy meter, first introduced in the previous Mortal Kombat game, allows players to perform techniques such as \"X-Ray\" special moves. Similarly to NetherRealm Studios' previous title, Injustice: Gods Among Us, fighters are able to interact with the environment, bouncing off areas to reposition themselves or using parts of the environment as weapons. In addition, each fighter has three different variations, each featuring a different set of moves they can use during the fight: for example, the character Scorpion features a Ninjutsu variation in which he wields dual swords, a Hellfire variation which relies more on fiery special moves, and an Inferno variation which allows him to summon hellspawn minions to aid him in the fight. The sprint gauge, which was last seen in Mortal Kombat 4/Gold, returns in this game. MKX features two new types of finishing moves: Quality, which will instantly kill a player's character if they quit during a multiplayer match; and Faction Kills, finishing moves tied to each of the game's five factions. Brutality finishing moves make a comeback from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 in the form of enhanced versions of certain moves that are triggered when they are used to give the opponent the last attack in a round. The game's play modes include Story, 1 vs. 1 Ranked, King of the Hill, Survivor, and Test Your Luck. A new addition called Living Towers is an evolved form of Mortal Kombat's Challenge Tower where the play conditions will be changing every hour. Another new mode is Faction Wars, where the players will have to choose one from the five factions (Black Dragon, the Brotherhood of Shadow, the Lin Kuei, Special Forces, and White Lotus) to align with and join a persistent online cross-platform competition with the others, winning points for their faction to contribute in the conflict between them, ranking up personally, and earning special rewards such as faction-specific finishing moves if the player's faction win at the end of any given week. Plot: Two years after the defeat of Shao Kahn, Shinnok attacks Earthrealm with his army of Netherrealm forces, including the Earthrealm warriors who were killed during Kahn's invasion and are now resurrected as revenants under Quan Chi's control. After fighting their fallen comrades, a strike team led by Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, and Kenshi open a portal to Raiden's Sky Temple and head to the Jinsei Chamber, the source of Earthrealm's life force, where Raiden and Fujin are battling Shinnok and his Netherrealm forces. During the fight near the Jinsei, they distract Shinnok long enough for Raiden to steal Shinnok's amulet and imprison him inside it, but Quan Chi escapes. Johnny and Sonya track him to his lair in the Netherrealm and defeat him, successfully restoring Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Jax to human form, though Quan Chi escapes again. In the years that follow, Johnny and Sonya marry and have a daughter, Cassie, and later divorce. Scorpion reinstates his Shirai Ryu clan while mentoring Kenshi's son Takeda, and Sub-Zero becomes the new Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei after killing Sektor. Twenty years after Shinnok's defeat, Johnny assembles a team of fighters composed of Cassie, Takeda, Jax's daughter Jacqui, and Kung Lao's cousin Kung Jin. After undergoing a training exercise with Sub-Zero, they are deployed to Outworld to resolve a civil war between former empress Mileena, who has obtained Shinnok's amulet from Kano, and Outworld's current emperor Kotal Kahn, with whom Earthrealm has a peace treaty. Sonya captures Kano and forces him to reveal Mileena's location. Using this information, Cassie's team aids Kotal in recovering Shinnok's amulet and capturing Mileena, who is subsequently executed on Kotal's orders. No longer believing Earthrealm capable of keeping the amulet safe, Kotal decides to keep it in Outworld's hands, and takes Cassie and her friends hostage as leverage against Raiden. Kotal's second-in-command D'Vorah, who is revealed as a double agent for Quan Chi, steals the amulet. Cassie and her team escape captivity, and inform Earthrealm of D'Vorah's intentions. Hoping to stop Quan Chi from getting the amulet, Jax and Kenshi, aided by Sareena, lead an assault on the Netherrealm. After fighting his way through the revenants, Jax captures a weakened Quan Chi, who is brought back to Earthrealm and held at an Outworld refugee camp. Scorpion, having learned from Sub-Zero the truth of Quan Chi's involvement in the deaths of his family and clan, infiltrates the refugee camp alongside his clan with the intent of assassinating Quan Chi, defeating Kenshi, Johnny and Sonya in the process. As Scorpion prepares to kill Quan Chi, D'Vorah arrives with the amulet. Quan Chi manages to finish a spell moments before being beheaded by Scorpion, releasing Shinnok from captivity. Weakened by the Shirai Ryu's previous attack, Johnny is taken prisoner by Shinnok and D'Vorah. With the aid of Quan Chi's revenants, Shinnok and D'Vorah assault the Sky Temple, where they subdue Raiden. Shinnok then enters the Jinsei and corrupts it, transforming himself into a powerful demon in the process. Cassie's team pursues Shinnok, only to be intercepted by Kotal Kahn and his army. They inform him of Shinnok's return and Kotal decides to kill them, hoping to appease Shinnok and buy time to bolster Outworld's defenses, but Sub-Zero and his Lin Kuei comrades appear just in time to repel the Outworld forces. At the Sky Temple, Jacqui and Takeda occupy the revenants, while Cassie and Jin enter the Jinsei chamber. There, Cassie defeats D'Vorah and Shinnok, and rescues her father. A grievously-wounded Raiden then purifies the Jinsei, stripping Shinnok of his powers and forcing the revenants to withdraw. Sonya and her soldiers arrive to take Shinnok and D'Vorah away, and the Cage family reunites. Some time later, the revenants Liu Kang and Kitana are revealed to have assumed leadership of the Netherrealm. Raiden, now in possession of Shinnok's amulet and hinted to have been corrupted in the process of purifying the Jinsei, warns them they will face \"fates worse than death\" if they threaten Earthrealm. As a final warning, he presents them with Shinnok's severed, yet still living, head."

        "daljsi_opis": "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare is the eleventh main game in the first-person shooter series. The single-player campaign is set in the future, around 2054, when Atlas, a private military corporation led by Jonathan Irons, has become the most powerful military organization on the planet. The player controls Jack Mitchell who starts as a soldier for the Marine Corps. He is stationed in Seoul, South Korea, with Will Irons. In a successful, but deadly mission against North Korea, 6.000 marines are killed including Will and Jack loses his left arm. At the funeral he is approached by Jack's father Jonathan who offers his a job at Atlas and where he receives a high-tech prosthetic arm. The story covers several years and locations as Atlas' intentions are slowly revealed. Next to Irons prominent characters are Gideon, Joker, Ilona, and his old sergeant Cormack. Countries and locations visited in the game include U.S.A., Greece, Bulgaria, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand, Antarctica, and Iraq. As the game is set in the future, Mitchell has access to high-tech exosuits that drastically enhance the soldier's abilities. Each mission provides a different type of suit with specific powers, such as the ability to double jump, use a grappling hook, hover through boosts, become invisible through cloak, launch grenades, provide a shield or additional health, and climb metallic surfaces. Compared to other Call of Duty games, there are more moments with slower action, the opportunity for stealth and a number of environments that are more open so different approaches can be considered. Mitchell can be upgraded by earning points through completing challenges, allowing him to reload faster or to take more damage. Various missions provide vehicles, such as a hoverbike, a speedboat with the ability to plunge underwater, heavy mech suits, a tank, and a fighter jet. The game does not use a regular HUD, but all information is projected on the weapon through a hologram. Next to regular weapons and grenades there are weapons that rely on lasers or energy. For multiplayer game modes include Capture the Flag and Hardpoint (returning from Call of Duty: Black Ops II), the flag based Momentum (based on the War game mode from Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War), Domination, Kill Confirmed and others. Entirely new is the objective based Uplink mode based on carrying satellites with two teams of four to six players. The loadout is called the Pick 13 system, a variation of the Black Ops II Pick-10 Create-A-Class system. Players have room for thirteen items or abilities, such as a primary weapon with different attachments, different perks, scorestreak rewards etc. Scorestreaks can be customized, a first for the series, but it makes the reward more expensive. There are also regular supply drops that provide items in three categories: enlist (common), professional (uncommon), and elite (rare). These include custom weapons and customization items called reinforcements. All collected items are stored in an armory, but they can also be exchanged for additional experience instead. Just like in single-player the exosuit abilities can be used, and some of them such as boost and the grappling hook alter the movement significantly. Like many of the previous games there is another, separate game mode, now called Exo Survival, very similar to the ones from Call of Duty: MW3 and Call of Duty: Ghosts. One to four players work together to survive multiple rounds, fighting off waves of enemies. There are four tiers to unlock and eleven rounds in total."

        "daljsi_opis": "Assassin's Creed: Rogue is the eighth main game in the historical series. It is the sequel to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag from the year before. It also acts as a prequel to Assassin's Creed III and the game's final mission is a prologue to Assassin's Creed: Unity, which was released simultaneously. Most of the gameplay and design is similar to the sandbox environment of Black Flag as the game combines exploration on land with ship-based naval exploration and battles. The protagonist is Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin recruit with a rebellious streak. He eventually becomes disgruntled with the order's tactics and becomes involved with the Templars as a feared Assassin Hunter, making it the first title in the series to control a Templar throughout the larger portion of the game. Many characters from the aforementioned games return, including Adéwalé from Freedom Cry. The familiar modern day sequences also return, this time playing as a new employee at Abstergo Entertainment who needs to explore Cormac's memories during a server crash. The game is set in the 18th century during the French and Indian War. The game's main locations are New York, the River Valley and the North Atlantic Ocean. The ice in the latter environment introduces new game mechanics, such as frozen cargo, icebergs used as cover and an ice-breaker ram to open up passages. Swimming in icy water damages Cormac's health and there are no underwater missions like in Black Flag. His ship Morrigan is smaller and can be used to travel through rivers. There are also new weapons such as oil barrels that can be ignited. Puckle guns are introduced, ships can be rammed, and the Morrigan can be boarded by enemies during ship-to-ship combat. Sea shanties return, with a mix of old and new ones. On land typical missions return. New weapons are air rifles and grenade launchers. The fighting mechanics have been altered to allow countering based on timing, rather than keeping a button pressed. As many opponents are Assassins, they use familiar techniques against Cormac such as air attacks, hiding in bushes and blending in with crowds. Gas is a new type of weapon and Cormac can avoid this by pulling a mask over his face. New animals to hunt include narwhals and polar bears. Passive income can be earned by restoring buildings in the main three locales. Certain regions need to be freed by taking on gangs that control them. As with previous games there are many collectibles and side quests. There is no multiplayer mode."

        "daljsi_opis": "Battlefield Hardline features new variety of gameplay that breaks away from the traditional Battlefield game modes. The focus of the game has been shifted to police and the \"war on crime\", breaking away from the military setting that has hitherto characterized the series. As such, the main factions in Hardline are the police Special Response Units and criminals. Players will have access to various military-grade weapons and vehicles, such as the Lenco BearCat, as well as having police equipment such as tasers and handcuffs. Hardline also uses the Levolution mechanic from Battlefield 4. For example, in the map \"Downtown\" players can send a construction crane crashing into the building, ripping down debris from the central buildings in downtown, which falls down on the streets of Los Angeles. But, this time, every map features multiple levolutionary events, both small and gigantic. Many new game modes are featured in Hardline, for instance: Heist, Rescue, Hotwire Mode, Blood Money and Crosshair Mode. Heist: The criminals must break into a cash filled vault (or as featured in some maps, blow open the doors of an armoured truck) then move the cash filled packages to an extraction point; the police must stop them. If the Criminals manage to escape by bringing all the money to the extraction point they win. Blood Money: Both factions must retrieve money from an open crate in the center of the map, then move it back to their respective side's armored truck. Players can also steal money from the opposing team's truck. The team that first deposits $5 million worth of money into their truck or the team with the most money under a time limit wins. Hotwire Mode: Drivable cars take the role of traditional Conquest \"flags.\" Like Conquest, capturing cars (done by driving above a certain \"cruising\" speed) will bleed the enemy team's reinforcement tickets. The team who reduces the other's to zero or who has the most tickets remaining after the time limit wins. Rescue: In a 3 minute long 5 vs 5 competitive mode, S.W.A.T officers must try to rescue hostages held by criminal forces. The cops win by either rescuing the hostage(s) or by killing all the criminals. Criminals win by killing all the cops. Each player has only one life in this mode, that means no respawns. Crosshair: The second competitive game mode in Battlefield Hardline. Crosshair is also 3 minutes long, 5 vs 5 with only one life. In Crosshair the criminals are trying to kill a player controlled VIP on the cops side who is a former gang member turned states witness. The criminals win by killing the VIP and the cops win by getting the VIP to the extraction point. Visceral Games ratified that the single-player campaign will not be linear and promised to deliver a better one than the predecessors. The campaign will feature episodic crime dramas where choices will heavily change situational outcomes and gameplay experiences. As a cop, players can use multiple police gadgets and personal equipments. The police badge can be used to strike fear into criminals' hearts and order them to lay down their weapons, the scanner is used to stake out a situation, identify high value-targets, log evidences, tag alarms, and mark other threats. To slip past unnoticed, players can use bullet cases to distract enemies."

For the Xbox One and the PS4 it is the first release of the game for the platform. For the PlayStation and Xbox versions of the game it is in some cases possible to carry over DLC and save data from the previous titles, also from 360 to One and PS3 to PS4. Owners of Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate for the PS3 and Xbox 360 can update their game for free to Last Round to play online matches against players of Last Round but need to buy the new content (characters such as Marie Rose, Phase 4, Nyotengu, Honoka, Raidou, and costumes) through DLC. The game as a single purchase is not available for the Xbox 360, see the trivia section. The game continues the typical DoA gameplay with 3D arenas and fighting on a 2D plane. Characters can sidestep and knock opponents through danger zones into other parts of the environment. Attacks consist of four buttons (light and strong punches and kicks) to perform combos, throws, blocking. There is no jump input. Advanced moves include counters, critical stun attacks and power blows. The game offers three play styles (casual, pro and online pro) and four main game modes: story, fight, training and online. Story consists of a series of one-round matches for different characters with cut-scenes and conversations that further the story and explain the motives of the different characters. Training consists of a 42-step tutorial where the game mechanics can be practiced. Online mode offers both ranked and lobby matches for online multiplayer. In lobby matches players can search for opponents and define settings such as the connection strength, region, minimum and maximum strength, fight rules, fight type and the number of rounds. The main fight mode offers the submodes versus, arcade, time attack, survival and team fight. Survival for instance is a series of fights against multiple characters in succession with a single health bar. There are solo, tag and team matches. Through an exhibition match players can unlock all characters and stages right away, but no new records or titles can be earned. Optionally throwdowns can be enable to see incoming online challenges from other players. The game offers 34 playable characters. All characters return from Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate, including those that were introduced through DLC (Marie Rose, Nyotengu and Phase-4) also including the guest characters Akira Yuki, Jacky Bryant, Pai Chan and Sarah Bryant. Entirely new for this version are Raidou (the boss from the first Dead or Alive) and Honoka. Fighters have different statistics based on strike, throw, hold, power, speed and moves and over 400 costumes that can be unlocked in-game or need to be purchased as DLC. For the arcade version the two new characters and balance changes were introduced in v2.0 of Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate - Arcade. All stages from Dead or Alive 5: Ultimate return with two new stages exclusive for the Xbox One and PS4 versions: Crimson (from Dead or Alive 2) and Danger Zone (Kazumi's stage from Dead or Alive). The PS3 and Xbox 360 version do not contain the new hairstyles and costume options screen, which allow you to customize your fighter’s appearance and preview it on the character select screen. The PC version was launched without online multiplayer, to be added at a later date, and it does not use the Soft Engine exclusive for the PS4 and Xbox One versions."

It was praised for its horror and the execution of the looping corridor, but was criticized for its complicated puzzles.

Later releases included a three-episode mission pack titled The Nocturnal Missions. The player assumes the role of a World War II Allied spy William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, who is trying to escape from Castle Wolfenstein, a Nazi German prison. After the initial escape episode, Blazkowicz carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis. Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games."

        "daljsi_opis": "The House of the Dead 4 is a horror-themed light gun shooter arcade game and the fourth installment of the House of the Dead video game series, developed by Sega. The game takes place between the events of The House of the Dead 2 and The House of the Dead III, and introduced several new gameplay concepts. Players can control characters James Taylor, from The House of the Dead 2 (on the left side), or Kate Green, a new character to the series (on the right side). The game was followed by House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn. The House of the Dead 4 is the first game to run on the Sega Lindbergh arcade system board. Player characters are equipped with submachine guns in this game, as opposed to semiautomatic pistols in the first two or shotguns in the third. The gun will fire in fully automatic mode as long as the trigger is depressed, and can be reloaded by shaking it or pointing away from the screen. Players can also find and throw grenades to destroy large numbers of enemies at once. Additional grenades can be earned by completing certain tasks or by shooting crates. At some points in the game, players are required to shake the gun vigorously in order to escape certain situations. The game features branching paths. Most of the paths lead to the same point in the game's story. As with The House of the Dead III, there is an end-of-stage bonus where players can receive extra lives depending on headshot level combo, accuracy, and score. Another returning factor is the presence of the \"Cancel\" bar. The game runs on a critical shots counter where the player is encouraged to shoot the enemy's weak points rather than spraying ammo at the enemy. It starts off as Good, Excellent, Amazing and then Perfect. Getting hit, or killing an enemy not by the weak point resets the counter. The most common enemies have three attacks: a \"normal attack\", a \"grab,\" and a \"push\". The foremost inflicts one point of damage, while the second forces a shaking sequence that, if successful, pushes back attackers for easier disposal, but if unsuccessful, will result in the player being bitten or the player's character being knocked down and vulnerable. Multiple zombies may also pile on top of both players in an attempt to stomp on them (or kick them while they're down). There are also a number of secrets in the game. Different hidden treasures, such as coins and golden shapes, which increase the player's score, as well as \"lives\", etc. can be found by interacting with the game's environments. The bonus-life system departs from the previous games, where life is gained by saving hostages; the loss of these events are substituted with an increase of extra-life pickups in the environment. There are also \"treasure rooms\" that can be accessed using different techniques (such as shooting a certain spot or throwing a grenade in a certain area), which contain multiple items that can be obtained at once within a limited time."

Broken Helix is considered a 4D game. For example, if you are on the third floor, you may have to make your way up to the fifth floor in order to defuse a bomb. There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die. There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to open doors.

While the Total War series traditionally focuses upon real historical scenarios, the plot of Spartan: Total Warrior is fictional, involving figures from both Greek and Roman mythology, and featuring many ahistorical elements (the most obvious being the Roman Empire and the Spartan state did not exist at the same time in history). It is also the only installment in the series to have been released for video game consoles rather than PCs or Macs. It was the first Total War game published by Sega, who had purchased Creative Assembly earlier in 2005. Spartan received a mixed to positive reception.

Set in an alternate history 1946, the single-player story follows war veteran William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz and his efforts to discover the locations of a Nazi compound. Development began in 2014, soon after the release of The New Order. The game is played from a first-person perspective and its levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress through the story. It is separated into two interconnected campaigns. The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, and explosives, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present; players lean in and out of cover instead of the more common system where players lock into cover. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood was met with a generally positive reception upon release. Many critics praised the game's intense firefights, intriguing locations, and the balance between stealth and action. Many critics disliked the game's story however, with most reviewers saying it was the weakest part of the game, and that it is a step back compared to The New Order‍ '​s story, which was heavily complimented."

It is the follow-up to Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but not a direct sequel. Rather, it continues the time progression of battles in the past in the first Black Ops game, modern and near future combat in the second game, and now a game in a far dystopian future set in 2065, 40 years after the previous title. A first for the series, the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions do not have the main single-player campaign, only the multiplayer portion and additional game modes such as Zombies. The single-player campaign is substantially longer compared to the previous games. The game is set in the same universe as Black Ops II and references some past events indirectly. For instance, the focus in the story is back on group troops following the aftermath of the drone strikes by Menendez in the second game. Set in the far future, soldiers are now equipped with DNI, the Direct Neural Interface. It allows them to communicate directly with computers and machines, and it can also be used to read the thoughts and memories of people. The player controls a male or female character and needs the DNI after a failed infiltration and hostage rescue mission from the NCR in Egypt. Your partner, Jacob Hendricks, undergoes the enhancements as well. Five years later the player character and Hendricks are under the command of CIA Agent Rachel Kane investigating a CIA black site in Singapore. Through a series of events the player ends up in Egypt and Switzerland. The story deals with an artificial intelligence called Corvus, the role of privacy, the effects of cybernetic enhancements, secret CIA experiments, and also the characters Commander John Taylor and Dr. Yousef Salim. Missions include linear first-person shooter levels with free movement as well as sections played shooting from a stationary position such as a vehicle. As the game is set in the future, various futuristic technologies are available. By progressing through the game new weapons and gadgets are unlocked. The most important ones are the new abilities called Cyber Cores and Cyber Rigs. Cores provide new abilities and attacks, while Rigs influence movement and agility, opening up powerslides, wallruns and boosted jumps. There are three types of Cores and only one can be equipped per loadout. They enable the player character to distract with decoy drones, boost the character in strength or speed, attack or take over robots or keep opponents occupied with swarms of bees. The campaign can be played cooperatively with up to four players."

The game is set in the late 19th century and, in contrast to the predecessors, tells not one big case but six smaller, independent ones. Three of them are original stories and two (The Fate of Black Peter and The Abbey Grange Affair) are based on Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. The Riddle on the Rails takes the basic premise of Doyle's story The Lost Train, but the rest of the story is original. All cases involve Holmes investigating a murder. Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments is an adventure video game in the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series developed by Frogwares and published by Focus Home Interactive for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in 2014. The game takes place in London and its suburbs in 1894 and 1895, towards the end of the 19th century; it resonates with the Russian novel Crime and Punishment by author Fyodor Dostoyevsky focusing onto finding the right culprit and making the moral choice of absolving or condemning them. The game is the first in the series to use the Unreal Engine 3, and was inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. The game is split into six cases of murders, disappearances and thefts written in the tradition of Doyle novels."

        "daljsi_opis": "ZombiU is a first-person horror survival game based on the heritage of Zombi, the first game published by Ubisoft. The game is set in London, England, and the player controls a random survivor of a zombie apocalypse and starts in a metro station. Next to surviving, the protagonist is also after a cure to combat the outbreak, which was first predicted 400 years earlier as The Black Prophecy by John Dee, an astronomer and adviser to the queen. A secret society known as the 'Ravens of Dee' researched his predictions and worked towards finding a cure. The members hide in a bunker and one is chosen by the Raven leader Sondra to confront the zombies. The spiritual leader is called Prepper and assists the character through radio during missions by providing hints and overlooking the situation when the character manages to restore the power to the CCTV cameras. When those are online, Prepper can draw maps of the surroundings that are displayed on the GamePad. Meanwhile, Dr. Knight, one of the Queen's doctors, also searches for the cure as a panacea under Buckingham Palace. The protagonist explores different locations, needs to take out zombies, and collects items and weapons. True to the spirit of survival horror, it features a form of permadeath. If the character becomes killed or infected, which is possible with a single bite, he slowly turns into a zombie and if no medicine to combat it is found, another character from the bunker is sent out to continue the mission, but without the gathered items or weapons. In the hardcore Survival mode the consequences are fiercer as the entire campaign needs to be restarted with no option to revert back to an earlier point. Basic items when starting are a flashlight, a gun, some ammo and a cricket bat. Ammo is scarce and needs to be spent wisely. In most situations riskier melee weapons are used to save the firearms for the most difficult encounters. Even then, only head shots are effective. It is however possible to track down the former protagonist and kill it to reclaim the inventory. Next to the basic items there are also medicine, grenades, molotov cocktails and wooden planks to barricade doors. Barricading doors and hacking combinations locks is done in context-sensitive situations through the GamePad's touchscreen. In other situations it displays the mini-map (when available), and it is used as a sniper scope or to manage the inventory. Additional items can be stored in the home base. The device's gyroscope is used to scan the environment by holding the left trigger. The GamePad is held up towards the TV and acts as a scanner to view the surroundings, even through walls. At those moment the game turns to a fixed third-person view where the character remains vulnerable. Discovered items in unexplored rooms through scans are stored on the mini-map to help locate them. Attacking requires a careful approach. When fighting with the bat for instance, holding the left trigger is used to block, and to attack the right trigger needs to be held. Once released, the bat is swung. If the right one is held too long, the character becomes tired with the raised arm and lowers it again. As the movement is slow, it requires precise timing during fights and only a small amount of zombies can be attacked that way at once. The right trigger is also used to shake off zombies. They generally leave the character alone when no sound is made or when he has not been spotted. Therefore most situations require the isolation of zombies from larger groups. When the Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters can appear as zombies in the game, and clues or hint tagged on walls can be seen by other players in their games. Multiplayer is available for two players and only offline. One player uses the GamePad and is King Boris, king of the zombies. The environment is shown using a top-down view of the entire level and the king can put zombies in the game while the other player uses a standard controller (Wii Remote with Nunchuk or Pro Controller) to complete the levels. The asymmetric multiplayer is organized around three game modes and five maps, but with the same type of gameplay, including elements of capture-the-flag and domination game types. The later released ports for other platforms work without the above described inclusion of the Wii U GamePad. All special gimmicks like the scan function are either triggered with a button press or are otherwise integrated into the UI, e.g. the map is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen. Online capabilities and multiplayer are completely gone,"

        "daljsi_opis": "After the happenings of Saints Row: The Third, the Saints gang extended their reach and the protagonist became the President of the USA. Unfortunately during a press conference, disaster happens: aliens attack the White House, kidnap the Saints and trap each in their personal, indefinitely looping nightmare. Fortunately Kinzie, the group's hacker, rescues the protagonist and together they flee into a space ship with the goal to rescue the rest of the gang. The majority of the game it spent in an open world simulation of Steelport, the location of Saints Row: The Third. There is an extensive character creation which allows to tune every aspect of the protagonist's look and the choice between seven voices (three male, three female and Nolan North). Saints Row IV continues the course of its predecessor into over-the-top action and humour. The twist of this game is that the protagonist receives super powers within the simulation, e.g. super jump, fast running or telekinesis, which help with moving fast and killing aliens which replace cops as law enforcement. Those powers make driving practically unnecessary, but the player may still hijack and use cars. Third-person fights with melee and ranged weapons still play an important role. Like all Saints Row games, it features various side activities which can be activated in certain points of the game world. Then the game switches to the mini game and after completing it, the player is rated with either bronze, silver or gold medal depending on the performance. While some of the games are known from the predecessors, e.g. fraud or tank mayhem, the majority are new and are designed around the superpowers. For example, there is a race in which the player needs to solve a running course as fast as possible and another one requires to jump precisely on platforms. While those mini games were an essential part of the main mission line in previous Saints Row games, this time they are only required for the team members' side quests. The main storyline features varied missions which mostly involve moving to a point and killing everything in sight, but also various sequences parodying other genres like side-scrolling brawlers or top-down shooters. Additionally there are other side activities like collecting audio diaries or destroying the aliens' infrastructure points. While the members of the team need to be saved from their nightmares in the simulation, they are physically trapped on the main alien ship. To save them, the protagonist visits the ship a few times during the main storyline without having superpowers available - but sometimes a mech instead. Otherwise, the real world only plays a minor role: the simulation can be exited to walk around the ship and talk to the team members. Besides starting missions, the only purpose is to parody the Mass Effect series and its romances.  Progressing in the game gives rewards: experience points (used to unlock personal upgrades like better damage resistance or more damage with certain weapons) and cache (used to purchase weapons, ammo and weapon upgrades) is rewarded for all actions in the game, but of course finishing missions and activities is most profitable. New super powers are automatically unlocked during the storyline, but they also have upgrades like sliding through the air after a super jump or more damage for blasts. These upgrades require another currency: small glowing balls which are all over the city and need to be collected. Some powers also can be modified in effect, e.g. the blast can be set to fire or ice. The mobile phone is used to requesting unlocked cars and unlocked homie helpers (the main crew receives super powers when finishing their side quests), looking on the map or playing licensed music in the background.  Multiplayer is either playing co-op during the campaign (the second player basically replaces the homie) or starting one of two competitive activities."

The world's militaries fought them with everything they had, but in the end, only one force stood a chance: The EDF, a coalition of humanity's greatest soldiers and scientists. Finally, we shot down their mothership and brought peace to the world...  ...for about eight years. It's 2025 now, and our worst fears have come true: That was only the first wave.  But this is not the end. This time, we ARE ready. The EDF has developed over 500 different weapons and vehicles. Our Rangers are crack shots with all kinds of weapons. Our Wing Divers rain down death from above. Our Fencers are walking, steel-clad arsenals. And our Air Raiders can seize control of the battlefield. If it takes four score and seven battles, if we have to fight in the streets, on the beaches, or alongside our allies in cyberspace, we'll fight and we'll win.  Now and forever, we are the Earth Defense Force."

        "daljsi_opis": "Ride to Hell: Retribution is an action game that incorporates different gameplay elements. The game is set in 1969 in America and has Jake Conway as the protagonist, a biker and Vietnam veteran. When he comes back he goes to live with his brother Mikey and uncle Mack. When his brother is killed in a gang-related murder by a rival biker gang, he goes on a quest for vengeance. The game combines driving sections on a bike while fighting off bikers and dodging obstacles similar to the Road Rash games, on-foot sections with exploration and combat based on blocking, melee and ranged weapons, and rail shooter driving sections where someone else takes the wheel and Jake gets to aim and shoot as a sidecar gunner. All types of gameplay incorporate many quick time events, both in combat and while driving. Other game elements include chases (with jumps, power slides and obstacles that need to be dodged) and pursuits, hunting, deliveries and saving girls. The story is largely furthered through cut-scenes and new locations are often reached after long driving sections. Most missions have a time limit. Jake's bike can be customized through decals, paint jobs and body parts. The game features a rock soundtrack by the band Rival Sons."

It was developed by Pandemic Studios, published by THQ and released in 2006 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows. Six months after the fall of the regime, the coalition had established an interim government to transition Zekistan into democracy, but severe problems were also emerging. Various insurgencies began to plague the country and ethnic divisions were again causing sectarian conflict. Across the country, the Mujahideen Al-Zeki, an Al-Afad loyalist group led by Mullah Abdul Hassan began to fight coalition troops in an attempt to re-establish the old regime. Another key faction was the Anser Al-Ra’id, a northern ethnic Zeki faction led by Mullah Qari Ra’id, seeking northern ethnic Zeki independence in the province of Tien Hamir under his rule. The previously peaceful province and its regional capital city, Khardiman, became a focus of the fighting in the country when Mujahideen forces stage an uprising, bringing them into conflict with American forces, British UN Coalition forces, National Militia forces under the control of regional governor Andrei Zakirov and the Anser Al-Ra’id forces. To make matters worse, Anser Al-Ra’id forces soon turn on American, Coalition and National Militia forces. But British forces were able to re-take the Tien Hamir Bridge from insurgent control and US forces were able to re-take most of the city, halting a possible civil war between the Mujahideen, Al-Ra’id forces and government. The game was divided into four chapters, each chapter containing three missions. The first chapter takes place in present time, while the other three chapters were precursors to the first chapter."

Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process. Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The \"free play\" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game."

The game differentiates itself further from official games by giving the players an off-field presence, often involving sex, performance-enhancing drugs and violence. The game has input from the writer for Playmakers, the football-based soap opera the NFL forced ESPN to cancel. Blitz: The League has 8-man teams, and makes spectacular action-packed moves easier than in real life. Impressive moves boost your Clash meter, which allows you to pull off unrealistic moves, such as easier running due to Bullet Time, and some brutally tough defences tackles. If these tackles happen frequently enough the players will fight hockey-style, lunging into wild tackles. The team with the most tackles from this gains the Unleashed mode, which has even more gruesome moves, of a style the NFL would not allow to be associated with their product. Additional features include multiplayer action with head-to-head online play and complete customization options of players, teams, stadiums and more. Lawrence Taylor appears as the poster boy."

This time the protagonist is Lincoln Clay. He is a veteran of the Vietnam War and part of a black mob. The game is set in 1968 in New Bordeaux, a fictional environment inspired by New Orleans, which consists of ten districts. There are busy city environments, but also large stretches of swamps, the countryside, canals ... When circumstances force Clay to pay back a debt to the Marcano crime family, he is betrayed and his mob friends along with his surrogate father Sammy are all killed. Left for dead, he is rescued by his friend Father James and gets in touch with his former Vietnam CIA handler John Donovan. Clay is out for revenge to destroy the Marcano family and seize control of New Bordeaux. The story is told as flashbacks by survivors in different segments incorporating cut-scenes. Next to the various missions there is a larger, faction/assets system where decisions influence the alliance with three important characters. There is Cassandra who leads the Haitian mob, Thomas Burke with ties to the IRA and the Italian gangster Vito Scalleta, the protagonist of Mafia II, who had to leave Empire Bay after killing the don Falcone. Lincoln is mostly on his own and needs their support to hold the territory he captures. Territory does not only provide an income, each faction assigned to it also provides different types of services such as muscle, providing cars and locations or arms dealers, sabotaging phone lines to prevent back-up, bribing the police etc. similar to a skill tree where new abilities are unlocked. A district is taken over after a number of rackets have been captured along with killing the capo who leads it. Each faction also provides a constant stream of missions in the open world with a cash reward. As in the previous games there is free-roaming gameplay where any vehicle can be stolen and driven. Different types of gameplay styles are possible, involving melee fights or ranged gunplay, with brute force or using a stealth approach combined with a cover system. Using a wiretapping junction box or with the Inside Man bonus it is possible to eavesdrop and see enemies through walls using Clay's Intel Vision, similar to the Eagle Vision of Assassin's Creed. Enemies can be lured away by whistling. Missions include infiltration, killing targets, performing heists, destroying goods, stealing cars, intercepting drugs etc. Large buildings are often used for missions played inside that specific location. There is also a large amount of collectibles including different magazines, paintings and old album covers. Not all missions are scripted, some events are triggered based on actions in the environment or attacks by hit squads. When the police becomes involved, there is a blue search zone that needs to be escaped. NPCs will often report crimes and they can be killed to prevent this, but this often leads to a chain reaction."

        "daljsi_opis": "Mother Russia Bleeds is a 2D side-scrolling brawler with pixel art graphics. The game is set in an alternate Soviet Union in the 1980s. A group of four gypsy fighters — Boris, Ivan, Natascha and Sergei — is imprisoned and treated with a new drug called Nekro, under the influence of the Russian mafia working together with the authorities. They escape from the facility, but permanently suffer the effects of the drug and decide to go after the mafia. The game supports up to four local players working together, but with 'friendly fire'. The game can also be played in single-player, optionally with additional characters as bots controlled through the AI. The game takes place in locations such as a prison, a ghetto, a sex club, a prison, a laboratory etc. with vivid depictions of gore and explicit violence. Characters visually sustain damage and brutal fatalities can be performed. Basic controls include horizontal and vertical movement, jumping, and dashing. Basic attacks are a punch and a kick that can be combined into combos. It is also possible to grab and hit or throw characters, slide or punch while dashing, mash downed opponents, attack in the air, and charge punches. The game also incorporates lots of weapons like bats and knives. Having to fight 20 or 30 characters at once is not uncommon and they each have different attacks, strengths and weaknesses. A character's health bar is tied to the Nekro drug. Certain defeated opponents will convulse for a short time, providing a brief window to sample their body to extract the Nekro drug. This fills a syringe in the top left corner; but a character is very vulnerable while doing so. The liquid can be injected to restore some life or to go bezerk. While bezerk movement becomes faster and attacks are much more powerful for a short while. That way, sampling Nekro is largely a risk-reward mechanic. There is an unlimited amount of continues, but starting again at the latest checkpoint. Next to the main story mode there is a wave-based arena survival mode, supporting the same type of player options. The four characters have different statistics based on force, jump, range and speed. Next to a character an ability can be selected, but most of these need to be unlocked first."

The player takes control of John Cord, MI6 agent chosen for the assignment. His investigation turns out to be anything but simple. In Cold Blood has characteristics of an adventure game, a stealth game, and a shooter. It relies on puzzle-solving but also includes action segments. Progress in the game is mostly achieved by collecting items and talking to various characters to find clues. Many conversations consist of multiple-choice dialogues. At certain points it is necessary to use stealth to proceed undetected, or attempt to solve the situation violently. Combat is fairly simple and consists of melee fighting (punches) or shooting."

It is an open world game that can be explored on foot or by driving cars, trucks, buses, boats or bikes. Just like in the original game the protagonist, now Marcus Holloway, is a member of the Dedsec hackers collective. The game is now set in San Francisco, Oaklan, Marin and Silicon Valley with a size twice as large as Chicago in the previous game. Again the group goes against the control of ctOS (Central Operating System), now in 2.0 version, as a means to control all of the city as well as to spy on its citizens. There are many famous landmarks in the game with special attention to the Silicon Valley and its many companies and employees which are often the centre of jokes. Many story sequences are presented as cut-scenes. At the start of the game Holloway is not a member of the collective yet. He is identified by ctOS as a potential threat and this leads him to breach the data centre and delete his ctOS profile, which impresses the Dedsec group. The fellow hackers he works with are Horatio, Josh, Sitara and Wrench. The goal is to take down ctOS and its company Blume. They also raise awareness as completing missions is rewarded with followers, people who take notice, as a means to further the narrative. The different missions can often be completed in various ways. Enemies can be approached directly with gunplay, but most assignments encourage the use of stealth and a large amount of technological gadgets often accessed and controlled through Holloway's in-game smartphone. Typical actions include hacking phones for voice and text messages, changing traffic lights, disabling security systems, taking over camera systems, controlling cars, turning junction boxes into proximity mines and so on. The quadrocopter is entirely new as a drone that can be flown to scout locations as often terminals need to be reached with puzzle sections before a hack is successful. Another type of drone is a remote-controlled car can be driven to hack terminals from a remote location. Hacking is also often a means to attack enemies from a distance, for instance by activating cars and driving them into opponents. Marcus has some acrobatic, parkour-like moves to get around. Additional options become available through an upgrade system. There are three categories which fit different playstyles: Agressor, Ghost and Trickster. Holloway is able to issue fake warrants so random citizens are arrested in police actions. He can also lure gangs into wars to make a location less densely populated. When he attracts too much attention himself the police attempts to hunt him down. Money earned during missions can be spent in various ways, for instance by creating weapons through 3D printing. Many side missions and additional information can often be found by snooping on anyone walking around. Cars can be stolen or they are delivered using an phone app. Large distances can also be crossed using a fast travel system. There are optional eKart races, also rewarded with money and followers. Sailing and participating in races is supported as well. Holloway can be customized through a large amount of clothing options. The single-player game morphs seamlessly in a multiplayer environment when there is an online connection. That means that other online players can be encountered at any moment. Players can choose to cooperate and work together on missions or they can hack each other. In the latter called invasions someone installs viruses on another player's system and needs to complete the process and escape. The targeted player can win by locating or killing the hacker in the vicinity before time runs out. Players can also work together to neutralize other players causing havoc in a Bounty Hunter session."

        "daljsi_opis": "Resident Evil 7 is the seventh main game in the series and the first one from the canon series to switch from 3rd-person to fully 1st-person perspective. The game features Ethan as the entirely new protagonist not seen in any of the previous Resident Evil titles. He arrives to a farm house in rural part of Louisiana in search of his missing wife, Mia. His wife disappeared several years ago without a trace, and his only clue was a video file of her he has on computer telling him that if he ever sees that message, that he should stay the hell away from here and forget about her. What man could just give up on his wife so easily... Ethan definitely isn't the one to accept the current situation and has come looking for her wife and doesn't plan to return without her... or the truth behind her disappearance. While the game progressively introduces more weapons and increases level of action as the story progresses, it starts with protagonist in a fairly helpless situation seeing how main foes cannot be killed so easily, and when they are killed, they don't stay dead for long. Ethan will find himself running for his life or trying to hide in order to save the bullets for when he may really need them. The inventory size is limited and can be increased by collecting additional backpacks, and items cannot be dropped anywhere to be collected later. Instead, there are various item boxes around the map, mostly in save rooms near the tape recorders which are used to save game progress, where player can store and retrieve items (the boxes are all \"magically\" connected, so stored item in one box can be retrieved from another). There are four weapon slots for quick change, while the rest of the slots are just for holding items. Healing items have their own configured button which uses healing items in order of lower healing property (if you have small and big healing potions, small one will be used first). The game is not paused while using inventory, and it doing so in a dangerous area, enemy can attack you while you're in the middle of it. Ethan arrives at a farm in Louisiana on a trail of his wife, and before too long he finds clues that his wife was or still is in the vicinity. But she does not seem to be herself anymore which she painfully demonstrates on him. Whatever she and the family that still lives on the farm are now, Ethan is still mere mortal who can feel severed limbs or being stabbed. However, the liquid substance used for healing seems to solve that problem for him if used in time. The game was built for VR from the get going so it can be played entirely in VR mode or regular 2D mode on a TV or monitor. The VR mode sacrifices resolution for level of realism and uses headset for aiming (your character automatically aims at the point you are looking at). In VR mode, character's hands are also shown a bit more than just seeing fists holding a weapon which additionally adds to a level of realism. Going back to the origins of Resident Evil games, rooms were connected by doors which serve as loading screen animation between rooms, not showing you what is in the other room. This game does the same (apart from loading) in a way that when you open some door, you don't see through it but picture starts to appear after you pass through, so one may never know who or what awaits behind the door. RE7 is as much horror as it is survival, boosting up scare elements and minimizing downright shooting action which offers normal and hard difficulty, while unlocking nightmare difficulty level upon completing the game. For the big part of the first half it seems more like a game from Silent Hill franchise, but as you move toward the ending it all starts to make sense and Resident Evil franchise starts to become apparent again, leaving any questions (i.e. what happened to Zoe, how does Chris Redfield play into all this, where did Lucas go, etc.) to be answered in story-based DLCs. The game uses auto-save feature, but also supports manual saves in save rooms at the audio recorders. There is no need for save-game material like using ink ribbon to save at typewriter in earlier RE titles. Japanese release of the game has some gore tuned down heavily and has been released as regular (gore-less) and grotesque version. However, even grotesque version release is not fully uncensored and still has some key elements removed or tuned down in comparison to US or European releases."

The missions need to be completed under time pressure to earn grades and to continue the campaign, making it a fast-paced version of the Rainbow Six games. There are 2 game modes, arcade and simulation, that influence the amount of information shown on the screen and the reaction time of the terrorists. The goal of each mission is to rescue hostages and eliminate terrorists as quickly as possible. There are 4 main scenarios, set at locations such as the Parliament, a remote farm, an underground complex and the Iranian embassy. Each of them must be completed 3 times, every time with another team on a different part of the map. Multiplayer includes cooperative missions, and Sabre Team, where a small squad of well-equipped SAS members takes on a larger team of terrorists.

The world as we know it is slowly starting to become unhabitable, as many people on Earth have moved to Mars for a better quality of life, thanks to a government subsidy that assisted in relocating citizens by providing affordable passage. After several years of running this program, the government announces that in two weeks, tickets to Mars would go up in price, making the exodus to the Red Planet unobtainable for regular citizens. You’ll deliver pizzas, collect gun parts, hunt bounties, and make some fans along the way.

In Will Rock, the player takes on the persona of the title character Willford Rockwell, an archeology student, who is faced with the aftermath of a fanatical group called the Olympian Restoration Army (ORA), who have managed to bring back to life a host of mythological creatures from Ancient Greece, including Zeus, king of the Gods, who has abducted Will's girlfriend Emma. Will is recruited by Prometheus, the Greek Titan of fire and craft, to destroy Zeus and his minions—and rescue his girlfriend. There are ten levels in the single player and coop versions. Many reviewers noted the massive numbers of enemies, prompting IGN to remark that it \"elevates the experience to a kind of inspired lunacy.\""

        "daljsi_opis": "12 is Better Than 6 is a top-down shooter with twin stick controls set in 1873 in North America and with a western setting. The protagonist is a Mexican slave who on the run, looking to make his way from Mexico to Texas while being chased by headhunters. After the tutorial the game is divided into four large acts where many different towns are visited along with encounters with characters that further the story. The game uses a hand drawn pen-and-paper art style and everything is coloured in shades of purple, except for the red trails and blotches of blood. The gameplay has many elements similar to Hotline Miami. Aside from using the same perspective, there is brutal violence and gun play that requires fast reflexes as a single shot is usually deadly. It is possible to go in all guns blazing, but it is more effective to draw out enemies one by one. There are also many sections in the game that require or encourage stealth, using a knife or a bow for instance. There is an unlimited amount of lives, but often there is trial-and-error involved to find an approach that works, so many areas will need to be played multiple times. The Mexican carries a limited number of dynamite sticks that cause large explosions, along with a single melee and a single ranged weapon. Ranged weapons are revolvers, shotguns, rifles, but also stationary Gatling guns. Weapons have a limited amount of ammo and manual reloading is required. It is also not possible to keep shooting just until a clip is empty. There is a quick reloading mechanic that requires the player to release the mouse button used for aiming to load another bullet in the chamber, before it becomes possible to aim and shoot again. This heightens the tension in situations where multiple enemies need to be taken out in succession. Some weapons provide a wider range where it possible to slightly scroll the screen to look ahead. Additional ammo is picked up from dead bodies and it is also possible to swap weapons that way. Enemies also leave behind money used to buy perks such as homing rats carrying dynamite, a breastplate with a 50% chance for bullets to deflect, dual-wielding, twice the amount of ammo, and loading two bullets at once. The game is largely linear, but there are some optional parts or scenes that can be approached in different ways or sometimes even be ignored. Especially after the first act the game opens up and for instance offers side missions. Often it is possible to search cabinets and other locations for items. Many parts of the environment can be used to seek cover or to hide. Enemies often hear shots or screams, they investigate bodies and their guard patrol path is shown through footsteps that disappear after a while. They do not react to the Mexican's footsteps, mainly the line of sight. Next to the main game there is an endless survival arena mode where players worldwide can compete for the best score, staying alive as long as possible and defeating waves of enemies."

Kaede and her classmates have been kidnapped from around the country and taken to the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, where Monokuma is joined by five \"Monokuma Kubs\" to host the latest killing game. Gameplay is much the same as in past installments; the story is broken up into Daily Life, Deadly Life, and Class Trial segments, each of which has its own mechanics and goals. An added gameplay mechanic is the ability to tell lies during trials in order to lead the conversation in a desired direction. While optional, lying can help the player clear trials faster and provoke different reactions from the other students. The trials also have two new forms of debates and several revamped minigames. After the main story is cleared, side modes are unlocked. These include a successor to School Mode and Island Mode from previous games, a combination board game/RPG featuring students from both Hope's Peak and the Ultimate Academy, and a dating sim."
